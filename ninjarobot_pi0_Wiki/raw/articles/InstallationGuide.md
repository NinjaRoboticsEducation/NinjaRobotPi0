*For the lastest Raspberry Pi Bookworm 64-bit OS your will encounter "Package 'pigpio' has no installation candidate" error.
You can only install pigpio from the sorce, here is the step-by-step solution:

Here is the complete, step-by-step guide to installing `pigpio` on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W running the latest Raspberry Pi OS (Bookworm 64-bit).

This guide is designed to navigate the specific security changes in the new OS (PEP 668) and fix the common installation errors (missing candidates, `distutils` removal, and shared library linking issues).

---

## 🛠️ Complete pigpio Installation Guide (Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm 64-bit)

**Target Hardware:** Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W 
**Target OS:** Raspberry Pi OS "Bookworm" (64-bit)

## Phase 1: System Preparation

Before starting, ensure your system package list is up-to-date and you have the necessary tools to compile software from source.

1. **Install build tools:**
We need `make` and `gcc` (included in `build-essential`) to compile the C library, and `unzip` to handle the download.
```bash
sudo apt install -y build-essential unzip wget

```



---

## Phase 2: Compile and Install the C Library

Since the `pigpio` package was removed from the standard repository in Bookworm, we must install it from the source code.

1. **Download the source code:**
```bash
wget https://github.com/joan2937/pigpio/archive/master.zip

```


2. **Unzip and enter the directory:**
```bash
unzip master.zip
cd pigpio-master

```


3. **Compile the code:**
```bash
make

```


4. **Install the library:**
```bash
sudo make install

```


> **⚠️ IMPORTANT EXPECTED ERROR:**
> You will likely see an error at the end saying:
> `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'distutils'`
> `make: *** [Makefile:107: install] Error 1`


> **Ignore this error.** It happens because the installer tries to install the Python bindings using an outdated method. The core C library (which is what we really need from this step) has installed successfully. We will fix the Python part in Phase 4.



---

## Phase 3: Fix Shared Library Linking

This step fixes the error: `pigpiod: error while loading shared libraries: libpigpio.so.1: cannot open shared object file`.

1. **Update the system library cache:**
The installer placed `libpigpio.so` in `/usr/local/lib`, but the OS doesn't know it's there yet. Run this command to register it:
```bash
sudo ldconfig

```



---

## Phase 4: Install the Python Library

Since the automatic Python installation failed in Phase 2, we will install the Python interface manually using a method compatible with Bookworm.

**Option A: The Recommended Method (APT)**
Try this first. It installs the pre-compiled Python wrapper provided by the OS maintainers.

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pigpio

```

**Option B: The Fallback Method (PIP)**
If Option A fails (unable to locate package), use `pip`. Note the `--break-system-packages` flag, which is required on Bookworm to allow installation outside a virtual environment.

```bash
sudo pip3 install pigpio --break-system-packages

```

---

## Phase 5: Create the System Service (Auto-start)

This step fixes the error: `Failed to enable unit: Unit pigpiod.service does not exist`.
We must manually create the configuration file to tell the system how to run the daemon in the background.

1. **Create the service file:**
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/pigpiod.service

```


2. **Paste the following configuration:**
(Copy and paste the text below into the editor)
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Pigpio daemon
Documentation=https://github.com/joan2937/pigpio
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=forking
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/pigpiod
# ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/pigpiod -l
# (Uncomment the line above with -l if you want to restrict access to localhost only)

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```


3. **Save and Exit:**
* Press `Ctrl + O` then `Enter` to save.
* Press `Ctrl + X` to exit.


4. **Enable and Start the service:**
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable pigpiod
sudo systemctl start pigpiod

```



---

## Phase 6: Verification

Let's verify everything is working correctly on your Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.

1. **Check the Daemon:**
Run the `pigs` command (pigpio command-line tool).
```bash
pigs t

```


**Success:** You should see a large number (the current microsecond timestamp).
**Failure:** If it says "socket connect failed", ensure you ran `sudo systemctl start pigpiod`.
2. **Check Python:**
Create a quick test script:
```bash
python3 -c "import pigpio; pi=pigpio.pi(); print('Connected:', pi.connected)"

```


**Success:** It should print `Connected: True`.

---

## 🧹 Cleanup (Optional)

You can now remove the source code files to save space on your SD card.

```bash
cd ~
rm -rf pigpio-master master.zip

```

**Troubleshooting Tips for Zero 2 W:**

* 
**Performance:** The Zero 2 W is powerful (Quad-core), but if you are running heavy compiles, it may get warm. Ensure it's not enclosed in a case without ventilation during the `make` process.


* **Remote Access:** If you plan to control the GPIOs remotely from a PC, remember to remove the `-l` flag in the service file created in Phase 5 to allow network connections.

Reload systemd setting
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```


### Step 4.4: Install Python Package Manager (uv)

We use `uv` for faster and more reliable Python package management:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

After installation, close and reopen your terminal, or run:

```bash
source $HOME/.local/bin/env
```

Verify installation:

```bash
uv --version
```

You should see a version number like `uv 0.x.x`.

### Step 4.5: Start pigpio Daemon

The `pigpio` daemon must run in the background for hardware control:

```bash
sudo pigpiod
```

> [!TIP]
> To make `pigpiod` start automatically on boot, run:
> ```bash
> sudo systemctl enable pigpiod
> sudo systemctl start pigpiod
> ```

### Step 4.6: Install Node.js

The web interface (`ninja_webapp`) requires Node.js to be built. Install it using NodeSource:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs
```

Verify installation:

```bash
node -v && npm -v
```

You should see version numbers like `v20.x.x` and `10.x.x`.

---

## 5. Service Setup (Gemini AI & ngrok)

### Step 5.1: Create Google Gemini API Key

The robot uses Google's Gemini AI for natural language understanding.

1. **Go to Google AI Studio**: https://aistudio.google.com/
2. **Sign in** with your Google account
3. Click **"Get API Key"** in the left sidebar
4. Click **"Create API Key"**
5. Select **"Create API key in new project"** or choose an existing project
6. **Copy the API key** that appears (it looks like: `AIzaSy...`)
7. **Save this key** somewhere safe—you'll need it later

> [!WARNING]
> Keep your API key private! Do not share it publicly or commit it to version control.

### Step 5.2: Create ngrok Account

`ngrok` creates a public URL so you can control your robot from anywhere.

1. **Go to ngrok**: https://ngrok.com/
2. Click **"Sign up"** and create a free account
3. After signing in, go to: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken
4. **Copy your Authtoken** (it looks like: `2a...`)
5. **Save this token**—you'll enter it when you first start the robot's web server

---

## 6. Project Installation

### Step 6.1: Clone the Repository

Navigate to your home directory and clone the project:

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/NinjaRoboticsEducation/NinjaRobotPi0.git
cd NinjaRobotPi0
```

> [!NOTE]
> If the repository is private or you're using a different source, adjust the URL accordingly.

### Step 6.2: Create a Virtual Environment

It is best practice to install Python packages in a virtual environment to avoid conflicts.

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

You should see `(NinjaRobotPi0)` or `(.venv)` appear at the start of your terminal line.

### Step 6.3: Install All Dependencies

Install the project dependencies into the virtual environment using one of these methods:

**Method A: `uv sync` (Recommended)**

```bash
uv sync
```

`uv sync` automatically reads `pyproject.toml`, resolves all dependencies, and installs them into the `.venv`. This is the simplest and most reliable method.

**Method B: `uv pip install -e .` (Alternative)**

```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

This installs the project in editable (development) mode. Use this if you need more control over the installation process.

> **Difference:** `uv sync` creates/manages the `.venv` automatically and uses a lockfile for reproducible installs. `uv pip install -e .` installs into an existing virtual environment without a lockfile.

Both methods will:
- Install all Python dependencies (including `pigpio`)
- Set up all the robot's libraries in editable mode
- Make all CLI commands available (`pi0vl53l0x`, `pi0servo`, etc.)

The installation may take 5-10 minutes.

### Step 6.4: Build the Web Interface

The robot's web interface is built with React. Build it with:

```bash
cd ninja_webapp
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
```

This creates the `ninja_webapp/dist/` folder that the server will use.

> [!NOTE]
> If you see errors during `npm install`, ensure Node.js was installed correctly (Step 4.6).

### Step 6.5: Verify Installation

Check that the main command is available:

```bash
ninja_core --help
```

You should see a list of available commands like `chat`, `server`, `config`, etc.

---

## 7. Hardware Calibration & Testing

Before running the robot, you need to initialize, calibrate, and test each hardware component individually. This ensures that every component's configuration file (`display.json`, `buzzer.json`, `servo.json`) is created and verified **before** importing them all into the main `config.json`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Follow the steps in order. Each step creates or updates a configuration file that will be imported in Step 7.6.

### Step 7.1: Display Setup

Initialize the display by running the interactive setup wizard:

```bash
uv run pi0disp init
```

Follow the prompts to select your display profile and configure GPIO pins (DC, RST, BLK). This creates `pi0disp/display.json`.

Test the display with an image:

```bash
uv run pi0disp image assets/images/sample_face.jpg
```

You should see the image on the display. Test additional features:

```bash
# Text rendering
uv run pi0disp text "Hello NinjaRobot"
uv run pi0disp text "忍者ロボット" --lang ja --scroll

# Brightness control
uv run pi0disp brightness 50
uv run pi0disp brightness 100

# Animation demo (Ctrl+C to stop)
uv run pi0disp demo --num-balls 3

# Health check
uv run pi0disp info --health-check
```

### Step 7.2: Buzzer Setup

Tell the system which GPIO pin the buzzer is connected to. This creates `buzzer.json`:

```bash
uv run pi0buzzer init 17
```

Test the buzzer:

```bash
uv run pi0buzzer beep
uv run pi0buzzer play happy
```

You should hear a short beep, then a happy emotion sound.

### Step 7.3: Distance Sensor Test

Run the built-in self-test to verify the VL53L0X sensor is connected:

```bash
uv run pi0vl53l0x test
```

Take a few live readings:

```bash
uv run pi0vl53l0x get --count 5 --interval 1.0
```

You should see 5 distance readings in millimeters.

Check the sensor status (firmware, offset, health):

```bash
uv run pi0vl53l0x status
```

Optionally, calibrate by placing an object at a known distance (e.g., 100 mm):

```bash
uv run pi0vl53l0x calibrate --distance 100 --count 10
```

### Step 7.4: Servo Calibration

Each servo needs to be calibrated to define its minimum, center, and maximum positions. This creates `servo.json`.

For each servo (example for GPIO 20):

```bash
uv run pi0servo calib 20
```

Follow the on-screen instructions:
1. Press `v` to select **Min** position
2. Use **Up/Down** arrow keys for large adjustments, **w/s** for fine-tuning
3. When the servo is at its minimum position, press **Enter** to save
4. Press `c` to select **Center** position, adjust, and press **Enter**
5. Press `x` to select **Max** position, adjust, and press **Enter**
6. Press `q` to quit

**Repeat this for all 8 servos** (GPIO pins: 20 through 27)

Test a servo after calibration:

```bash
uv run pi0servo move 20 0
uv run pi0servo move 20 45
uv run pi0servo move 20 -- -45
```

### Step 7.5: Set Gemini API Key and Model

Configure the AI agent with your API key (replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the actual key from Step 5.1):

```bash
uv run ninja_core config set-key gemini YOUR_API_KEY
```

NinjaRobot then retrieves the models available to this key from Google. Select one of the numbered Gemini models shown. Only models that support agent content generation are listed. NinjaRobot runs a bounded minimal generation request and saves the key/model pair only if the selected model responds. Validation can take up to 60 seconds for a thinking model. A network error, rejected key, non-responsive model, or cancelled prompt leaves the previous configuration unchanged. Gemini 3 models may take several seconds because they use thinking; NinjaRobot requests the supported low thinking level and reports a visible timeout instead of waiting indefinitely.

### Step 7.5A: Guided NinjaRobot Initialization Tool

For classroom setup, you can use the guided initializer instead of running each configuration command separately:

```bash
uv run ninja_core init-tool
```

The menu provides these actions:

1. Set Gemini API Key and Model
2. Set ngrok Token
3. Rename the Ninja Robot
4. Select NinjaRobot Type (`Tire`, `Humanoid`, or `Spider`)
5. Import All Hardware Configuration
6. Show Existing Hardware Configuration
7. Start NinjaRobot Server
8. Exit

The "Show Existing Hardware Configuration" option prints the same sanitized robot profile sent to the Code IDE over Bluetooth. It includes `robot_type` and `hardware_configuration.servos.gpio_pins`, but never prints Gemini API keys or ngrok tokens.

### Step 7.6: Import All Hardware Configurations

Now that all components are initialized and tested, import their configurations into the main `config.json`:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This step reads from `servo.json`, `buzzer.json`, and `pi0disp/display.json`. Make sure Steps 7.1–7.4 are completed first.

```bash
uv run ninja_core config import
```

You should see:
```
Found servo config at 'servo.json'. Importing...
...imported calibration for 8 servos.
Found buzzer config at 'buzzer.json'. Importing...
...buzzer import complete.
Found display config at 'pi0disp/display.json'. Importing...
...imported display pins: DC=18, RST=19, BLK=20, rotation=90
Configuration updated and saved to config.json!
```

> [!TIP]
> If you change any hardware wiring or recalibrate a component later, run `uv run ninja_core config import` again to sync the changes.

### Step 7.7: Name Your Robot

To make Bluetooth discovery easier when you have multiple NinjaRobots nearby, save a custom BLE name:

```bash
uv run ninja_core config set-name "Classroom Ninja 1"
```

Guidelines:
- Keep the name under 29 UTF-8 bytes so it fits in BLE advertising packets.
- Use quotes if the name contains spaces.
- Restart `uv run ninja_core server` (or reboot the Raspberry Pi) after changing the name so the new Bluetooth name is advertised.

When you scan from the NinjaRoboticPlatform Code IDE or nRF Connect, look for the new name instead of the default `NinjaRobot`.

### Step 7.8: Select NinjaRobot Type

Select the robot type so the Code IDE can tailor Blockly synchronization after Bluetooth connection:

```bash
uv run ninja_core config set-type tire
uv run ninja_core config set-type humanoid
uv run ninja_core config set-type spider
```

Only one type is active at a time. The guided initializer's "Select NinjaRobot Type" option calls the same setting. Restart `uv run ninja_core server` after changing the type so the next `robot_info` profile contains the updated value.

#### Troubleshooting Bluetooth Rename and Discovery

On the Raspberry Pi, update dependencies and restart cleanly:

```bash
cd ~/NinjaRobotPi0
uv sync
sudo rfkill unblock bluetooth
sudo systemctl restart bluetooth
uv run ninja_core server
```

If it still fails, run this Pi-side diagnosis:

```bash
systemctl status bluetooth hciuart --no-pager
rfkill list bluetooth
bluetoothctl show
journalctl -u bluetooth -b --no-pager | tail -100
```

If `bluetoothctl show` has no controller or says not powered, fix the Pi Bluetooth stack first:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y pi-bluetooth bluez
sudo systemctl enable --now bluetooth hciuart
sudo rfkill unblock bluetooth
sudo reboot
```

---

## 8. System Integration Testing

With all components individually verified and configurations imported, test the full system.

### Test 8.1: AI Agent Test (Text Chat)

Test the AI chat in terminal mode:

```bash
uv run ninja_core chat
```

## 9. Running the Robot

### Start the Web Server

This is the main way to interact with your robot:

```bash
uv run ninja_core server
```

On **first run**, you'll be prompted to enter your **ngrok authtoken** (from Step 5.2). Paste it and press Enter.

The robot will:
1. Initialize all hardware
2. Start the web server
3. Create a public URL via ngrok
4. Display a QR code on its screen

### Access the Web Interface

You have two options:

#### Option A: Scan the QR Code (Recommended)

Use your smartphone to scan the QR code displayed on the robot's screen. This will open the web interface in your phone's browser.

#### Option B: Local Network

On any device on the same WiFi network, open a browser and go to:
```
http://ninjarobot.local:8000
```
(Replace `ninjarobot` with your hostname if different)

### Web Interface Features

Once connected, you can:

1. **Chat with the Robot**:
   - Type messages in the text box
   - Or click the **microphone icon** and speak (select language first)
   - The robot will respond in the same language

2. **Control Servos**:
   - Select a movement from the dropdown
   - Click **Execute**

3. **Show Facial Expressions**:
   - Select an expression (happy, sad, etc.)
   - Click **Show**

4. **Play Sounds**:
   - Select an emotion sound
   - Click **Play**

5. **Monitor Distance**:
   - Real-time distance readings appear at the top

### Supported Languages

- **English** (en-US)
- **日本語** (ja-JP) - Japanese
- **繁體中文** (zh-TW) - Traditional Chinese
- **简体中文** (zh-CN) - Simplified Chinese

### Stopping the Server

Press **Ctrl+C** in the terminal to stop the server. The robot will perform a **graceful shutdown animation**:
1. Display a "sleepy" face on the LCD
2. Play a "sleepy" sound melody
3. Move servos to the "Poweroff" rest position
4. Safely shut down all hardware

---

## 10. Automatic Startup (Optional)

If you want the robot to start automatically when you turn on the power, follow these steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have completed all previous steps, including hardware calibration and API key setup. The robot must be fully functional before enabling autostart.
>
> **Ngrok Requirement:** For autostart to work, you **must** have a valid ngrok authtoken configured. If the token is missing, the service will fail to start to avoid hanging in the background.

### Step 10.1: Install the Startup Service

Run the following command:

```bash
uv run ninja_utils install-startup
```

This will:
1. Check if your system is ready (config exists, pigpiod running, etc.)
2. Create a systemd service file
3. Enable the service to start on boot

### Step 10.2: Verify

You can check the status of the service:

```bash
uv run ninja_utils status-startup
```

### Step 10.3: Reboot

Reboot your Raspberry Pi:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

The robot should start automatically. You can access the web interface via the QR code or `http://ninjarobot.local:8000` after a minute or two.

> [!TIP]
> **Safe Shutdown:** You can safely shut down the robot using the "Power Off Robot" button at the bottom of the web interface. The robot will display a "sleepy" face, play a sound, and move to its rest position before powering off. Wait for the green light on the Raspberry Pi to stop flashing before unplugging the power.

### Removing Autostart

If you want to stop the robot from starting automatically:

```bash
uv run ninja_utils remove-startup
```

---

## 11. Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Could not connect to pigpiod daemon"

**Solution**:
```bash
sudo pigpiod
```

Then try running your command again.

### Problem: Display not working

**Checks**:
1. Verify SPI is enabled: `sudo raspi-config` → Interface Options → SPI
2. Check wiring matches the pin table in Section 2
3. Run the display health check: `uv run pi0disp info --health-check`
4. **Verify GPIO pin configuration**: Run `uv run pi0disp init` to register your display pins, then `uv run ninja_core config import` to sync them to `config.json`. A common cause of blank displays is mismatched GPIO pins between `display.json` and `config.json`.
5. Reboot: `sudo reboot`

### Problem: Distance sensor not responding

**Checks**:
1. Verify I2C is enabled: `sudo raspi-config` → Interface Options → I2C
2. Check if sensor is detected:
   ```bash
   sudo i2cdetect -y 1
   ```
   You should see `29` or `52` in the output
3. Check wiring (VCC to 3.3V, not 5V)
4. Run the built-in diagnostic:
   ```bash
   uv run pi0vl53l0x test
   uv run pi0vl53l0x status
   ```
5. If status shows errors, try power-cycling the sensor and re-running `uv run pi0vl53l0x test`

### Problem: Servos not moving

**Checks**:
1. Ensure external 5V power supply is connected and turned on
2. Verify common ground between Pi and servo power supply
3. Check servo signal wire connections
4. Recalibrate servo: `uv run pi0servo calib <PIN>`

### Problem: "ImportError" or "ModuleNotFoundError"

**Solution**:
Reinstall the project:
```bash
cd ~/NinjaRobotPi0
uv pip install -e . --force-reinstall
```

### Problem: "Component Initialization Failed" Warning

**Cause**: One hardware component (like the sensor or display) is disconnected or faulty.
**Solution**: The robot is designed to be **fault-tolerant**. It will log a warning and continue starting up with the working components. You can check connections later.

### Problem: Web server won't start

**Checks**:
1. Ensure port 8000 is not already in use
2. Check if ngrok authtoken is set correctly
3. Restart the server with verbose output:
   ```bash
   uv run ninja_core server --log-level debug
   ```

### Problem: AI agent not responding

**Checks**:
1. Verify Gemini API key is set:
   ```bash
   cat config.json | grep gemini
   ```
2. Check internet connection
3. Re-set API key:
   ```bash
   uv run ninja_core config set-key gemini YOUR_KEY
   ```

### Getting More Help

If you encounter issues not covered here:

1. Check the project's GitHub Issues page
2. Review the `DevelopmentLog.md` for known issues and fixes
3. Ensure all wiring matches the diagrams exactly
4. Try running individual component tests (Section 8) to isolate the problem

---

## 6. プロジェクトのインストール

### ステップ6.1: リポジトリのクローン

ホームディレクトリに移動してプロジェクトをクローン（コピー）:

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/NinjaRoboticsEducation/NinjaRobotPi0.git
cd NinjaRobotPi0
```

> [!NOTE]
> リポジトリがプライベートまたは別のソースを使用している場合は、URLを適宜調整してください。

### ステップ6.2: 仮想環境の作成

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

ターミナルの行の先頭に`(NinjaRobotPi0)`または`(.venv)`が表示されるはずです。

### ステップ6.3: すべての依存関係のインストール

以下のいずれかの方法で、プロジェクトの依存関係を仮想環境にインストールします:

**方法A: `uv sync`（推奨）**

```bash
uv sync
```

`uv sync` は `pyproject.toml` を自動的に読み取り、すべての依存関係を解決して `.venv` にインストールします。最もシンプルで信頼性の高い方法です。

**方法B: `uv pip install -e .`（代替方法）**

```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

プロジェクトを編集可能（開発）モードでインストールします。インストールプロセスをより細かく制御したい場合に使用してください。

> **違い:** `uv sync` は `.venv` を自動的に作成・管理し、ロックファイルで再現可能なインストールを行います。`uv pip install -e .` は既存の仮想環境にロックファイルなしでインストールします。

どちらの方法でも:
- すべてのPython依存関係がインストールされます（`pigpio`を含む）
- ロボットのすべてのライブラリが編集可能モードで設定されます
- すべてのCLIコマンドが使用可能になります（`pi0vl53l0x`、`pi0servo` など）

インストールには5〜10分かかる場合があります。

### ステップ6.4: Webインターフェースのビルド

ロボットのWebインターフェースはReactで構築されています。次のコマンドでビルド:

```bash
cd ninja_webapp
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
```

これにより、サーバーが使用する`ninja_webapp/dist/`フォルダーが作成されます。

> [!NOTE]
> `npm install`中にエラーが表示される場合は、Node.jsが正しくインストールされているか確認してください（ステップ4.6）。

### ステップ6.5: インストールの確認

メインコマンドが使用可能か確認:

```bash
ninja_core --help
```

`chat`、`server`、`config`などの使用可能なコマンドのリストが表示されるはずです。

---

## 7. ハードウェアの校正とテスト

ロボットを実行する前に、各ハードウェアコンポーネントを個別に初期化、校正、テストする必要があります。これにより、すべてのコンポーネントの設定ファイル（`display.json`、`buzzer.json`、`servo.json`）が作成・検証された状態で、メインの `config.json` にインポートされます。

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 手順に沿って順番に進めてください。各ステップで設定ファイルが作成され、ステップ7.6でまとめてインポートされます。

### ステップ7.1: ディスプレイのセットアップ

対話型セットアップウィザードでディスプレイを初期化します：

```bash
uv run pi0disp init
```

プロンプトに従ってディスプレイプロファイルと GPIO ピン（DC、RST、BLK）を設定します。これにより `pi0disp/display.json` が作成されます。

画像でディスプレイをテスト：

```bash
uv run pi0disp image assets/images/sample_face.jpg
```

画像がディスプレイに表示されるはずです。追加機能もテストしましょう：

```bash
# テキスト表示
uv run pi0disp text "Hello NinjaRobot"
uv run pi0disp text "忍者ロボット" --lang ja --scroll

# 明るさ制御
uv run pi0disp brightness 50
uv run pi0disp brightness 100

# アニメーションデモ（Ctrl+C で停止）
uv run pi0disp demo --num-balls 3

# ヘルスチェック
uv run pi0disp info --health-check
```

### ステップ7.2: ブザーのセットアップ

ブザーが接続されている GPIO ピンをシステムに伝えます。これにより `buzzer.json` が作成されます：

```bash
uv run pi0buzzer init 17
```

ブザーをテスト：

```bash
uv run pi0buzzer beep
uv run pi0buzzer play happy
```

短いビープ音、次にハッピー音が聞こえるはずです。

### ステップ7.3: 距離センサーのテスト

内蔵セルフテストを実行して、VL53L0X センサーが正しく接続されていることを確認します：

```bash
uv run pi0vl53l0x test
```

実際の測定を行います：

```bash
uv run pi0vl53l0x get --count 5 --interval 1.0
```

ミリメートル単位で5つの距離測定値が表示されるはずです。

センサーのステータス（ファームウェア、オフセット、ヘルスチェック）を確認：

```bash
uv run pi0vl53l0x status
```

オプションとして、既知の距離（例：100mm）にオブジェクトを配置してセンサーを校正できます：

```bash
uv run pi0vl53l0x calibrate --distance 100 --count 10
```

### ステップ7.4: サーボの校正

各サーボは、最小、中心、最大位置を定義するために校正する必要があります。これにより `servo.json` が作成されます。

各サーボについて（GPIO 20 の例）：

```bash
uv run pi0servo calib 20
```

画面の指示に従ってください：
1. `v`を押して**Min**（最小）位置を選択
2. **上/下**矢印キーで大きな調整、**w/s**で微調整
3. サーボが最小位置にあるときに**Enter**を押して保存
4. `c`を押して**Center**（中央）位置を選択、調整して**Enter**を押す
5. `x`を押して**Max**（最大）位置を選択、調整して**Enter**を押す
6. `q`を押して終了

**これを8つすべてのサーボで繰り返してください**（GPIO ピン: 20 から 27）

校正後にサーボをテスト：

```bash
uv run pi0servo move 20 0
uv run pi0servo move 20 45
uv run pi0servo move 20 -- -45
```

### ステップ7.5: Gemini API キーとモデルの設定

API キーで AI エージェントを設定（`YOUR_API_KEY` を実際のキーに置き換えてください）：

```bash
uv run ninja_core config set-key gemini YOUR_API_KEY
```

NinjaRobot は、このキーで利用できるモデルを Google から取得します。表示された番号付きの Gemini モデルから 1 つを選択してください。エージェントのコンテンツ生成に対応するモデルのみが表示されます。選択したモデルに対して時間制限付きの最小生成テストを実行し、応答した場合だけキーとモデルを一緒に保存します。思考モデルの検証には最大 60 秒かかる場合があります。ネットワークエラー、拒否されたキー、応答しないモデル、または選択のキャンセルが発生した場合、以前の設定は変更されません。Gemini 3 は思考処理のため数秒かかる場合があります。NinjaRobot は対応する低思考レベルを指定し、無期限に待たず明確なタイムアウトを返します。

### ステップ7.5A: NinjaRobot ガイド付き初期化ツール

教室でのセットアップでは、各設定コマンドを個別に実行する代わりに、ガイド付き初期化ツールを使用できます：

```bash
uv run ninja_core init-tool
```

メニューの「Set Gemini API Key and Model」では、API キーを非表示で入力し、同じモデル選択フローを実行します。

### ステップ7.6: すべてのハードウェア設定をインポート

すべてのコンポーネントの初期化とテストが完了したら、設定をメインの `config.json` にインポートします：

> [!IMPORTANT]
> このステップでは `servo.json`、`buzzer.json`、`pi0disp/display.json` を読み込みます。ステップ 7.1〜7.4 が完了していることを確認してください。

```bash
uv run ninja_core config import
```

次のように表示されるはずです：
```
Found servo config at 'servo.json'. Importing...
...imported calibration for 8 servos.
Found buzzer config at 'buzzer.json'. Importing...
...buzzer import complete.
Found display config at 'pi0disp/display.json'. Importing...
...imported display pins: DC=18, RST=19, BLK=20, rotation=90
Configuration updated and saved to config.json!
```

> [!TIP]
> ハードウェアの配線変更やコンポーネントの再校正を行った場合は、`uv run ninja_core config import` を再度実行して変更を同期してください。

### ステップ7.7: ロボットに名前を付ける

複数の NinjaRobot を近くで使う場合に Bluetooth 検出をしやすくするため、BLE 名を保存できます：

```bash
uv run ninja_core config set-name "Classroom Ninja 1"
```

ガイドライン：
- 名前は BLE 広告パケットに収まるよう **29 UTF-8 バイト以内** にしてください。
- 名前にスペースを含む場合は引用符で囲ってください。
- 変更後は `uv run ninja_core server` を再起動するか、Raspberry Pi を再起動して新しい Bluetooth 名を広告させてください。

NinjaRoboticPlatform Code IDE や nRF Connect からスキャンするときは、デフォルトの `NinjaRobot` ではなく新しい名前を探してください。

#### Bluetooth 名変更と検出のトラブルシューティング

Raspberry Pi 側で依存関係を更新し、クリーンに再起動します：

```bash
cd ~/NinjaRobotPi0
uv sync
sudo rfkill unblock bluetooth
sudo systemctl restart bluetooth
uv run ninja_core server
```

それでも失敗する場合は、Pi 側で次の診断を実行してください：

```bash
systemctl status bluetooth hciuart --no-pager
rfkill list bluetooth
bluetoothctl show
journalctl -u bluetooth -b --no-pager | tail -100
```

`bluetoothctl show` でコントローラーが表示されない、または powered ではないと表示される場合は、先に Pi の Bluetooth スタックを修復してください：

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y pi-bluetooth bluez
sudo systemctl enable --now bluetooth hciuart
sudo rfkill unblock bluetooth
sudo reboot
```

---

## 8. システム統合テスト

すべてのコンポーネントが個別に確認され、設定がインポートされたら、フルシステムをテストします。

### テスト8.1: AI エージェントテスト（テキストチャット）

ターミナルモードで AI チャットをテスト：

```bash
uv run ninja_core chat
```

これらのコマンドを試してください：
- `Hello`（ロボットが挨拶するはずです）
- `Show me a happy face`（嬉しい表情と音を表示）
- `こんにちは`（日本語で応答）
- `你好`（中国語で応答）
- `quit` と入力するか **Ctrl+C** を押して終了

> [!NOTE]
> ロボットは距離を継続的に監視し、近づきすぎると（<50mm）反応します。

---

## 9. ロボットの起動

### Webサーバーの起動

これがロボットと対話する主な方法です:

```bash

## 5. 服務設定（Gemini AI 與 ngrok）

### 步驟 5.1：建立 Google Gemini API 金鑰

機器人使用 Google 的 Gemini AI 進行自然語言理解。

1. **前往 Google AI Studio**：https://aistudio.google.com/
2. 使用您的 Google 帳戶**登入**
3. 點擊左側欄的 **「Get API Key」**
4. 點擊 **「Create API Key」**
5. 選擇 **「Create API key in new project」** 或選擇現有專案
6. **複製出現的 API 金鑰**（格式如：`AIzaSy...`）
7. **將此金鑰儲存在安全的地方**——稍後會需要

> [!WARNING]
> 請保密您的 API 金鑰！不要公開分享或提交到版本控制系統。

### 步驟 5.2：建立 ngrok 帳戶

`ngrok` 建立公開 URL，讓您可以從任何地方控制機器人。

1. **前往 ngrok**：https://ngrok.com/
2. 點擊 **「Sign up」** 建立免費帳戶
3. 登入後，前往：https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken
4. **複製您的 Authtoken**（格式如：`2a...`）
5. **儲存此 token**——首次啟動機器人的 Web 伺服器時需要輸入

---

## 6. 專案安裝

### 步驟 6.1：複製儲存庫

導航到您的家目錄並複製專案：

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/NinjaRoboticsEducation/NinjaRobotPi0.git
cd NinjaRobotPi0
```

### 步驟 6.2：建立虛擬環境

最佳做法是在虛擬環境中安裝 Python 套件以避免衝突。

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

您應該會在終端機行首看到 `(NinjaRobotPi0)` 或 `(.venv)`。

### 步驟 6.3：安裝所有依賴項

使用以下任一方法將專案依賴項安裝到虛擬環境中：

**方法 A：`uv sync`（推薦）**

```bash
uv sync
```

`uv sync` 會自動讀取 `pyproject.toml`，解析所有依賴項並安裝到 `.venv` 中。這是最簡單且最可靠的方法。

**方法 B：`uv pip install -e .`（替代方法）**

```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

以可編輯（開發）模式安裝專案。如果您需要更多安裝過程控制，請使用此方法。

> **差異：** `uv sync` 會自動建立/管理 `.venv`，並使用鎖定檔進行可重現的安裝。`uv pip install -e .` 安裝到現有虛擬環境中，不使用鎖定檔。

兩種方法都會：
- 安裝所有 Python 依賴項（包含 `pigpio`）
- 以可編輯模式設定機器人的所有函式庫
- 使所有 CLI 命令可用（`pi0vl53l0x`、`pi0servo` 等）

安裝可能需要 5-10 分鐘。

### 步驟 6.4：建置網頁介面

機器人的網頁介面是用 React 建置的。使用以下命令建置：

```bash
cd ninja_webapp
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
```

這會建立伺服器使用的 `ninja_webapp/dist/` 資料夾。

> [!NOTE]
> 如果 `npm install` 期間出現錯誤，請確保 Node.js 已正確安裝（步驟 4.6）。

### 步驟 6.5：驗證安裝

檢查主命令是否可用：

```bash
ninja_core --help
```

您應該會看到可用命令的清單，如 `chat`、`server`、`config` 等。

---

## 7. 硬體校準與測試

在執行機器人之前，您需要分別初始化、校準並測試每個硬體元件。這樣可以確保所有元件的設定檔（`display.json`、`buzzer.json`、`servo.json`）在匯入到主要的 `config.json` 之前，已經被建立並驗證。

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 請按照順序進行各步驟。每個步驟都會建立設定檔，這些檔案將在步驟 7.6 中統一匯入。

### 步驟 7.1：顯示器設定

執行互動式設定精靈來初始化顯示器：

```bash
uv run pi0disp init
```

按提示選擇顯示器設定檔並配置 GPIO 腳位（DC、RST、BLK）。這會建立 `pi0disp/display.json`。

使用圖片測試顯示器：

```bash
uv run pi0disp image assets/images/sample_face.jpg
```

您應該會在顯示器上看到圖片。測試其他功能：

```bash
# 文字顯示
uv run pi0disp text "Hello NinjaRobot"
uv run pi0disp text "你好世界" --lang zh-tw --scroll

# 亮度控制
uv run pi0disp brightness 50
uv run pi0disp brightness 100

# 動畫演示（按 Ctrl+C 停止）
uv run pi0disp demo --num-balls 3

# 健康檢查
uv run pi0disp info --health-check
```

### 步驟 7.2：蜂鳴器設定

告訴系統蜂鳴器連接到哪個 GPIO 腳位。這會建立 `buzzer.json`：

```bash
uv run pi0buzzer init 17
```

測試蜂鳴器：

```bash
uv run pi0buzzer beep
uv run pi0buzzer play happy
```

您應該會聽到一聲短促的嗶聲，然後是一段快樂的情緒音效。

### 步驟 7.3：距離感測器測試

執行內建自我測試以確認 VL53L0X 感測器已正確連接：

```bash
uv run pi0vl53l0x test
```

進行實際測量：

```bash
uv run pi0vl53l0x get --count 5 --interval 1.0
```

您應該會看到 5 個以毫米為單位的距離測量值。

檢查感測器狀態（韌體、偏移值、健康檢查）：

```bash
uv run pi0vl53l0x status
```

可選操作：將物體放置在已知距離（例如 100mm）處進行校準：

```bash
uv run pi0vl53l0x calibrate --distance 100 --count 10
```

### 步驟 7.4：伺服馬達校準

每個伺服馬達需要校準以定義其最小、中心和最大位置。這會建立 `servo.json`。

對於每個伺服馬達（以 GPIO 20 為例）：

```bash
uv run pi0servo calib 20
```

按照螢幕上的指示：
1. 按 `v` 選擇 **Min**（最小）位置
2. 使用 **上/下** 方向鍵進行大幅調整，**w/s** 進行微調
3. 當伺服馬達處於最小位置時，按 **Enter** 儲存
4. 按 `c` 選擇 **Center**（中心）位置，調整後按 **Enter**
5. 按 `x` 選擇 **Max**（最大）位置，調整後按 **Enter**
6. 按 `q` 退出

**對所有 8 個伺服馬達重複此操作**（GPIO 腳位：20 到 27）

校準後測試伺服馬達：

```bash
uv run pi0servo move 20 0
uv run pi0servo move 20 45
uv run pi0servo move 20 -- -45
```

### 步驟 7.5：設定 Gemini API 金鑰與模型

使用您的 API 金鑰設定 AI 代理（將 `YOUR_API_KEY` 替換為步驟 5.1 中取得的實際金鑰）：

```bash
uv run ninja_core config set-key gemini YOUR_API_KEY
```

NinjaRobot 接著會向 Google 取得此金鑰可用的模型。請從顯示的編號 Gemini 模型中選擇一個。清單只會顯示支援代理內容生成的模型。NinjaRobot 會對所選模型執行有時限的最小生成測試，只有模型成功回應時才會一起儲存金鑰與模型；思考模型的驗證最多可能需要 60 秒。若發生網路錯誤、金鑰遭拒、模型無回應或取消選擇，先前的設定不會被變更。Gemini 3 因思考處理可能需要數秒；NinjaRobot 會使用其支援的低思考等級，並在逾時時顯示明確錯誤，而不是無限等待。

### 步驟 7.5A：NinjaRobot 引導式初始化工具

在教室設定時，可以使用引導式初始化工具，取代逐一執行各設定命令：

```bash
uv run ninja_core init-tool
```

選單中的「Set Gemini API Key and Model」會隱藏輸入的 API 金鑰，並執行相同的模型選擇流程。

### 步驟 7.6：匯入所有硬體設定

所有元件初始化和測試完成後，將設定匯入到主要的 `config.json`：

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 此步驟會讀取 `servo.json`、`buzzer.json` 和 `pi0disp/display.json`。請確認步驟 7.1 至 7.4 已完成。

```bash
uv run ninja_core config import
```

您應該會看到：
```
Found servo config at 'servo.json'. Importing...
...imported calibration for 8 servos.
Found buzzer config at 'buzzer.json'. Importing...
...buzzer import complete.
Found display config at 'pi0disp/display.json'. Importing...
...imported display pins: DC=18, RST=19, BLK=20, rotation=90
Configuration updated and saved to config.json!
```

> [!TIP]
> 如果之後更改了硬體接線或重新校準了元件，請再次執行 `uv run ninja_core config import` 以同步變更。

### 步驟 7.7：為您的機器人命名

如果附近有多台 NinjaRobot，您可以儲存自訂的 BLE 名稱，讓 Bluetooth 掃描時更容易辨識：

```bash
uv run ninja_core config set-name "Classroom Ninja 1"
```

注意事項：
- 名稱請保持在 **29 個 UTF-8 位元組以內**，以便放入 BLE 廣播封包。
- 如果名稱包含空格，請使用引號。
- 變更後請重新啟動 `uv run ninja_core server`，或重新開機 Raspberry Pi，讓新的 Bluetooth 名稱開始廣播。

之後從 NinjaRoboticPlatform Code IDE 或 nRF Connect 掃描時，請尋找新的名稱，而不是預設的 `NinjaRobot`。

#### Bluetooth 重新命名與掃描疑難排解

在 Raspberry Pi 上更新依賴並乾淨地重新啟動：

```bash
cd ~/NinjaRobotPi0
uv sync
sudo rfkill unblock bluetooth
sudo systemctl restart bluetooth
uv run ninja_core server
```

如果仍然失敗，請執行以下 Pi 端診斷：

```bash
systemctl status bluetooth hciuart --no-pager
rfkill list bluetooth
bluetoothctl show
journalctl -u bluetooth -b --no-pager | tail -100
```

如果 `bluetoothctl show` 沒有控制器，或顯示尚未 powered，請先修復 Pi 的 Bluetooth stack：

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y pi-bluetooth bluez
sudo systemctl enable --now bluetooth hciuart
sudo rfkill unblock bluetooth
sudo reboot
```
