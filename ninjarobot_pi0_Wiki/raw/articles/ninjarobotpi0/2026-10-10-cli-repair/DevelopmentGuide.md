# NinjaRobotPi0 development guide — current workflow

## CLI launcher recovery — 2026-10-10

Current packaging delegates the five existing robot console commands exclusively to ninja_core/pi0servo/pi0disp/pi0buzzer/pi0vl53l0x. The root distribution remains ninjarobotpi0 but no longer duplicates those entry points. Installed root/provider RECORD files previously claimed the same launcher paths. Following the root rename, all five launchers were missing although their packages remained installed; normal sync did not repair them. The collision is confirmed. No prior transaction log establishes the exact deletion timing, so the rename-triggered removal is a grounded inference.

For an existing checkout containing this fix, use the normal user in a controlled maintenance session. Do not delete config/calibration or .venv. If another checkout is in use, publish the fix first, inspect git status and fast-forward its intended tracking branch; stop on errors and preserve local edits. Actual Python repair requires owner authorization and is distinct from diagnosis:

```bash
env -u UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT -u UV_PROJECT uv sync --locked --inexact --no-dev \
  --reinstall-package ninja-core --reinstall-package pi0servo \
  --reinstall-package pi0disp --reinstall-package pi0buzzer \
  --reinstall-package pi0vl53l0x
uv run --no-sync ninja_core --help
./install.sh --check
```

This rebuilds changed root metadata plus the five local providers, preserving locked dependency versions and extra/development packages via --inexact. It does not start hardware or change system packages/services. Missing interpreter/dependencies instead require completing the full installer after its dry-run. The full installer now forces locked provider reinstallation and checks all five executable paths; uv must support --reinstall-package. Normal uv run may sync packages, while --no-sync uses an already repaired environment without synchronization.

Only after CLI help and software checks succeed AND physical readiness is confirmed may the owner start uv run --no-sync ninja_core server or .venv/bin/ninja_core server. This can initialize/center hardware and open ngrok; shutdown may execute Poweroff. No server/device tool was started for this repair. Direct module help passed without the launcher. 105 focused tests passed; full root regression passed 331 tests (exit 0)/1 intentionally excluded protected-baseline test with 31 existing dbus_next deprecation warnings. Ruff, shell syntax, offline lock check and installer/repair dry-runs passed. Real environment repair/repaired-launcher help remain pending owner approval; no package installation in the actual environment is claimed.

This is a complete English-only candidate derived from the preceding full 2026-10-10 lifecycle manual. Prior translated sections are not copied into this new version, and all original versions remain untouched. Historical sections below retain their dated status; this recovery section governs the current CLI behavior. Wiki registration/ingestion/review and current-pointer updates remain owner-deferred.

See [repair plan](../../../../../docs/CLIEntryPointRepairPlan.md) and [validation](../../../../../docs/validation/CLIEntryPoints-2026-10-10.md).


## Lifecycle refinements — 2026-10-10

This complete new version is raw evidence for owner manual validation and later ingestion/review. The owner reports the preceding built-in feature was ingested and semantically reviewed. This version does not change registered sources, curated pages, current pointers or review records. Earlier dated sections retain their historical validation status; the current lifecycle behavior below supersedes their exit/reconnect/prompt descriptions.

Movement-tool option 6 deliberately executes configured Poweroff before HAL shutdown and configuration save, without subsequent centering. If Poweroff is absent, configured home is attempted (the Wheel/Humanoid default). Invalid/incompatible/missing poses are logged and refused; cleanup/save still run. Keyboard interrupts and initialization failures do not request extra recovery motion. Startup still centers servos. Poweroff can command extreme Spider targets; physical clearance and power readiness are required. HAL shutdown releases PWM rather than electrically holding the final pose.

The shared Home/Agent/Help layout maintains /ws/session with a server-issued HttpOnly ninja_web_session cookie. One browser identity owns web controls; same-cookie tabs share ownership. A second browser gets busy/4409 and cannot access APIs or auxiliary sockets. Existing API paths/payloads and distance/events messages remain, but every /api/ request and /ws/distance or /ws/events socket now requires the live primary session. Inactive API requests return 423; requests during shutdown return 503. Scripted REST clients must get the cookie from HTML and keep /ws/session open. This is ownership, not login authentication; BLE is unchanged and remains a separate protocol.

Clients ping every 10 seconds, server timeout is 35 seconds without input, and browser retry is every 3 seconds. Final disconnect cancels pending browser requests/greetings, aborts ongoing native/Blockly work, stops output and restores the saved ngrok URL QR, falling back to reachable LAN URL if tunneling failed. No reachable URL means no QR. RuntimePipeline suppresses automatic idle painting while waiting. Startup QR and session cleanup/handoff are serialized; blocking ngrok/QR/display work runs off the asyncio thread. The QR remains square on rectangular displays. Missing/failing displays cannot retain ownership. Shutdown skips QR cleanup to preserve Poweroff. Cookie plus connection-generation context prevents old threads from regaining access after the same browser reconnects; centering receives an optional lifecycle abort callback checked inside the controller motion lock. Abort is cooperative, not an instantaneous hardware safety guarantee.

Root distribution/lock identity and the default virtual environment prompt are ninjarobotpi0. The directory remains .venv. Installer runs uv venv --allow-existing --prompt ninjarobotpi0 --python /usr/bin/python3 .venv before locked production sync, without --clear. uv compatibility now includes venv --allow-existing/--prompt/--python. Dependency versions are unchanged. Existing local activation scripts/pyvenv.cfg were mechanically updated without installation; re-activate an existing shell to see the new prompt.

Executed software checks: 72 inert movement/session/runtime tests and 93 installer/upgrade tests passed. Full root regression passed 319 tests, with one intentionally changed protected-baseline test excluded and 31 existing dbus_next deprecation warnings (exit 0). Focused Ruff, frontend lint/production build, shell syntax, offline lock check, install dry-run, prompt activation, Node hook harness and documentation links passed. Initial installer fixture failures were corrected by preventing host Node selection from bypassing mocked systemctl; no running service was stopped. Generated frontend assets were rebuilt. Protected-core and wiki-mapping gates intentionally remain drifted; no hashes are refreshed. No actual servo/display/network service acceptance or new semantic review is claimed.




See [implementation plan](../../../../../docs/LifecycleRefinementsImplementationPlan.md) and [validation report](../../../../../docs/validation/LifecycleRefinements-2026-10-10.md).


## Native built-in movement architecture — 2026-10-09

This complete candidate version is staged for owner ingestion/review after manual validation. No registered source, curated page, current pointer or implementation fingerprint was updated by this feature task.

`builtin_movements.py` is hardware-free and loads the installed package resource `ninja_core/data/spider_otto.json`. The original repository pack/generator remain unchanged. Runtime adapts 19 `spider_otto_*` names to the proposal's `spider_*` names and adds its exact Poweroff definition (566 total steps). GPIO20–27 are required for Spider seeding. The owner confirmed Wheel/Humanoid should receive only `home`, all configured channels at zero/Slow; future gait definitions are deferred. Wheel is an input alias for canonical tire, preserving BLE/IDE type values.

Import and set_robot_type reconcile built-ins. Existing movements remain `name -> list`. New `movement_robot_types: Dict[str, str]` scopes managed/scoped movements; `builtin_movement_hashes: Dict[str, str]` tracks last imported values. Only entries matching their recorded hash are removed/replaced automatically; edits/custom collisions are preserved. Edited managed entries retain their original scope. Missing entries return on reimport. Loading an existing configuration does not seed/write it. Neither import nor type selection initializes HAL.

HAL selects channels from config.servos.calibration, then reads physical calibration through ConfigManager('servo.json'). Presence of config keys is not physical readiness. Shared discovery filters sequences against type and available pins. Controller revalidates the entire list before its first command: nonempty steps/targets, supported fields, canonical GPIO keys, available pins, finite nominal ±90 angles, F/M/S global modes and valid per-pin overrides. Known type prefixes and copied/renamed known Spider trajectories, including legacy Poweroff, enforce scope even without metadata. Arbitrary custom unscoped mechanics cannot be inferred; owner review remains necessary.

The controller serializes its own servo operations and retains ordered GPIO matching, omitted targets, speed overrides and positional easing. Driver abort halts subsequent steps without an unsolicited controller recovery pose. Callback polling occurs before and after a blocking driver step; immediate callback interruption inside a waypoint is not guaranteed. Independent direct driver/Blockly writers still depend on existing runtime ownership. CLI and agent post-task centering remains separate existing behavior.

CLI execute option 4, `GET /api/servos/movements` and agent capabilities use filtered names. `POST /api/servos/movements/{name}/execute` returns 404 for unknown names, 422 for invalid/incompatible data before runtime reclamation, and 409 for abort. The existing web dropdown consumes the unchanged list shape and logs HTTP rejection. Text/audio agent plans must use exact names for configured type. Invalid native chains are removed as a whole and logged while retaining conversational output; 32 entries and 1–20 integer repetitions per entry are allowed. Existing saved Blockly action chains remain separate.

Spider waypoints preserve target poses, not source periods, waits, continuous oscillator phase, measured travel or balance. Owner-supplied Poweroff commands extreme angles and may execute on server shutdown. All physical acceptance remains pending. Local regression results and raw-source candidates are in the implementation evidence and repository validation report. Protected-core hashes are intentionally not refreshed; runtime/package diffs require owner review. Wiki ingestion and semantic gates are explicitly deferred.




## Current checkout and authority

The embedded wiki is `ninjarobot_pi0_Wiki/`. Full manuals are immutable dated sources;
`project-knowledge.json` identifies the current versions. Root manuals are navigation pointers.
Use `python3 scripts/wiki.py setup` explicitly, then `prepare`. Search/check/lint commands
never install dependencies. Root AGENTS and shared skills control development across coding tools.

Protect robot/driver behavior with `python3 scripts/verify_core.py`. Installation and onboarding
are additive root/scripts tooling. Backend packages and robot locks retain their original identity.
Frontend presentation may change while routes, HTTP payloads, WebSocket events, units and shutdown
confirmation stay compatible. Current frontend metadata is React 19.2.0; imported React 18
claims below describe earlier documentation and are superseded for current package versions.

## 2026-10-08 audit workflow

README is now the comprehensive public introduction/quick-start requested by the owner,
following Pi5's format; its non-English sections are labelled summaries. The three root manual
files remain compatibility pointers. Preserve dated README/manual evidence when changing claims.
Onboarding guidance/retry/reuse/resume is additive orchestration; robot algorithms are unchanged.
New regression cases cover alias-safe calibration validation, private first credential writes,
invalid progress preservation, resume invalidation, retries, worker preflight and installer paths.
Explicit wiki setup clears UV_PROJECT and can find the installer-owned private uv binary.
Source preparation and query/check behavior remain separate. Record actual results in
`docs/validation/UpgradeAudit-2026-10-08.md`; physical and account acceptance remain pending.


## Software compatibility policy

The installer checks capabilities, not exact OS/Node/uv release equality:

- Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, Linux `aarch64`, Debian-based Raspberry Pi OS (`ID=debian`
  or `raspbian`), and a normal user are required. No release-codename allowlist remains.
  Bookworm and Trixie are the reference targets; other releases are not automatically
  hardware-qualified merely because they pass preflight.
- Python 3.10+ is needed by existing runtime annotations (for example `ninja_core/config.py`
  and `pi0servo/core/servo.py`). Optional wiki development requires Python 3.11+.
  Existing metadata still says >=3.9; this installer check reflects the stricter runtime
  requirement without changing the robot packages. Locked dependencies remain authoritative.
- Node 20.19+ within 20.x, or Node >=22.12.0, matches the committed Vite 7/plugin engines.
  Node 24.21.0 qualifies. npm must be executable; `npm ci` and the build still have to succeed.
- uv has no exact-version gate. Its `sync --help` must expose `--locked`, `--no-dev`,
  `--python`, `--directory`, and `--all-extras`. uv 0.9.26 satisfies this and passed an
  offline host `sync --locked --no-dev --dry-run` against the existing lockfile.
  The capability probe alone does not certify every future uv version; real locked sync
  must succeed, with its original error preserved if it fails.
- Compatible tools on PATH are reused before compatible private tools. Missing/incompatible
  tools use checksum-verified fallback downloads. Download pins are not installed-version
  requirements. System tools and calibration files are retained. The existing pigpio daemon
  qualification remains separate and unchanged.

`./install.sh --check` stays read-only. Missing `.venv/bin/python` or `.venv/bin/ninja_core`
still means installation is incomplete: run `./install.sh`, wait for **Software installed**,
then run `./install.sh --check`. Publish/fetch this change before retrying on the Pi.
No physical Pi, hardware, account, or network-service acceptance is implied by host checks.


## Installer recovery diagnostics

Read-only checks now show compatibility requirements and executable paths and local retry instructions. Installer failures
retain exit status and identify the failing stage; tests cover no-write diagnostics, timeout/exec
failures, checksum rejection, Python sync failure, cleanup and calibration preservation.
The README includes fast-forward update instructions for default-branch/detached checkouts.
No automatic Git update or hardware operation is added. Preserve settings and the first Pi error.

## Validation

Run focused installer/onboarding tests with mocked tools; run existing robot tests without hardware;
run driver suites separately. Run Ruff on new scripts/tests, frontend lint/build, mocked browser
checks, wiki tests separately, knowledge check, strict lint, links and indexes. Do not run a robot
server to test documentation or initialize hardware in a host unit test.

Create new dated sources, register/normalize explicitly, prepare a schema-v2 semantic plan, show
its diff, and apply within owner-approved scope. Review changed sourced pages honestly; preserve
valid reviews elsewhere. Update current pointers and reviewed implementation fingerprints afterward.
Never overwrite registered raw sources, blindly refresh hashes, or claim human/device verification.

Use `docs/validation/UpgradeValidation-2026-10-07.md` for actual results and manual Pi acceptance.
English: owner validation on Bookworm 64-bit remains pending.

## Preserved complete earlier development reference

The preceding guide is retained in full below. Older wiki mirror commands and root-manual

| `ninja_core/dispatcher.py` | Preserves the active execution request when duplicate `execute` commands are rejected |
| `ninja_core/dispatcher.py` | Broadcasts full execution log lines without transport-era truncation |
| `ninja_core/dispatcher.py` | Broadcasts structured Blockly syntax errors without reporting a false execution start |
| `ninja_core/safe_executor.py` | Compiles user code before starting the execution thread and keeps syntax failures from triggering hardware stop cleanup |
| `ninja_core/contracts.py` | Allows error events to carry structured `details` such as line, offset, and source text |
| `pi0vl53l0x/core/sensor.py` | Serializes whole VL53L0X ranging transactions so background monitoring and Blockly `robot.distance.read()` cannot interleave register writes |
| `ninja_core/perception.py` | Keeps distance monitoring alive after transient I2C failures and attempts sensor reinitialization after repeated failures |
| `ninja_core/api_wrappers.py` | Returns the documented 9999mm fallback for invalid sensor reads so Blockly obstacle checks do not treat sensor failure as a near obstacle |
| `ninja_ble` | BLE transport v2 remains the required path for large Blockly payloads and large runtime feedback |
| Runtime contract | `execute`, `stop`, `execution_status`, `execution_log`, `chat`, and `error` stay correlated by `request_id` |

### Key Changes (V5.2.6 - Native/Blockly Dual Pipeline):
| Component | Change |
|---|---|
| `ninja_core/runtime_pipeline.py` | **NEW** - Coordinates native robot behavior and uploaded Blockly execution ownership |
| `ninja_core/web_server.py` | Wires `RuntimePipeline` into AppState, Dispatcher, shared faces, shared sound, and native web actions |
| `ninja_core/dispatcher.py` | Switches to Blockly ownership only after syntax compilation succeeds, then restores native idle on completion, stop, or disconnect |
| `ninja_core/safe_executor.py` | Adds an execution `on_start` hook and shares native `AnimatedFaces` with Blockly code |
| `ninja_core/api_wrappers.py` | Prevents idle/expression display races by using the shared face engine; `robot.display.clear()` now creates an intentional Blockly display hold |
| Runtime contract | Direct web/native interaction preserves native functions, BLE Blockly upload temporarily stops native actions, and Stop/Disconnect restores native idle |

### Key Changes (V5.2.7 - GPIO Blockly Motion Contract):
| Component | Change |
|---|---|
| `ninja_core/api_wrappers.py` | Adds GPIO-first `robot.servos.move_pin()` and `robot.servos.move_pins()` wrappers for Blockly-generated motion code |
| `ninja_core/contracts.py` | Defaults new execute manifests to generator version `web-blockly-v2` while preserving manifest override support |
| `ServoArrayWrapper` | Normalizes `F`/`M`/`S` speed modes, clamps Blockly angles to `-90..90`, rejects unknown GPIO pins, and forwards batch moves to pi0servo `move_all_sync()` |
| Blockly contract | Code IDE motion blocks now address GPIO pins `20..27` directly and use pi0servo speed modes instead of legacy motion duration |
| Runtime compatibility | Existing index-based `robot.servo[n]` and `robot.servos.move_all()` remain available for direct Pi/native code and older scripts |

### Key Changes (V5.2.8 - Blockly Text & Music Contract):
| Component | Change |
|---|---|
| `pi0disp/effects/text_ticker.py` | Adds shared centered-text rendering and `auto` font-language resolution for static/scrolled Blockly text |
| `pi0buzzer/notes.py` | Adds built-in song catalog for Blockly music playback: `happy_birthday`, `jingle_bells`, `twinkle_twinkle_little_star`, `head_shoulders_knees_and_toes` |
| `pi0buzzer/core/music.py` | Adds `play_named_song(name)` for non-blocking saved-melody playback |
| `ninja_core/api_wrappers.py` | Adds `robot.display.text(...)`, `DisplayWrapper.stop()`, and `robot.buzzer.play_song(name)`; `request_stop()` now stops active scrolling text before restoring native idle |
| Blockly contract | Code IDE Text and Sound categories can now generate Show Text and Play Music blocks against the same Pi-side runtime contract |

### Key Changes (V5.2.9 - BLE Robot Naming):
| Component | Change |
|---|---|
| `ninja_core/config.py` | Adds persistent `bluetooth.name` config with BLE-safe normalization and `set_robot_name()` |
| `ninja_core/__main__.py` | Adds `uv run ninja_core config set-name "<name>"` for saving a custom Bluetooth discovery name |
| `ninja_ble/service.py` | Uses the saved name for Bless server startup and compact BlueZ advertisements instead of a hard-coded string |
| `ninja_core/web_server.py` | Starts BLE with the configured name and reports the active configured name via `/ble/status` |
| BLE workflow | Custom names must fit in 29 UTF-8 bytes and take effect the next time the BLE service starts |

### Key Changes (V5.2.10 - Saved Blockly Action Library):
| Component | Change |
|---|---|
| `ninja_core/action_library.py` | **NEW** - Stores complete Blockly action records uploaded from the Code IDE in `ninja_actions/*.json` |
| `ninja_core/dispatcher.py` | Adds `save_action` command handling, protected overwrite validation, `action_save_status` events, and saved-action replay through the SafeExecutor |
| `ninja_core/ninja_agent.py` | Loads saved Blockly action names alongside native config movements and can return `action_chain` plans for AI replay |
| `ninja_core/web_server.py` | Wires the action library into startup, dispatcher, agent refresh, and cooperative interruption for new chat requests |
| BLE contract | Code IDE `Save to Robot` uploads complete generated Python plus Blockly workspace metadata; robot-authored save results are cached by `request_id` and exposed through BLE status readback so missed browser notifications do not create false timeouts |

### Key Changes (V5.2.11 - Guided Initialization and Robot Profile Sync):
| Component | Change |
|---|---|
| `ninja_core/config.py` | Adds `robot_type`, robot type validation, sanitized hardware profile serialization, and `hardware_configuration.servos.gpio_pins` for Code IDE synchronization |
| `ninja_core/init_tool.py` | **NEW** - Provides `uv run ninja_core init-tool`, a guided setup menu for Gemini key, ngrok token, robot name, robot type, hardware import, profile display, and server start |
| `ninja_ble/service.py` | Extends the `robot_info` response with robot type and sanitized hardware configuration while preserving name-only fallback behavior |
| `NinjaRoboticPlatform Code IDE` | Uses received servo GPIO settings to switch Blockly servo pin fields from numeric fallback mode to profile-backed dropdown mode |

### Key Changes (V5.2.12 - Gemini Model Selection):
| Component | Change |
|---|---|
| `ninja_core/gemini_models.py` | **NEW** - Retrieves the API-key-specific Gemini model catalog from Google, follows pagination, and filters for Gemini models that support `generateContent` |
| `ninja_core/config.py` | Adds backward-compatible `gemini.model` configuration; legacy files default to `gemini-3-flash-preview` |
| `ninja_core/init_tool.py` | Extends Gemini key setup with an interactive model selection step and saves the key/model only after discovery and selection succeed |
| `ninja_core/ninja_agent.py` | Uses the selected model for initial agent creation and capability refresh without changing prompts or action processing |
| Compatibility | Non-Gemini `config set-key` behavior, the existing web key endpoint, BLE profiles, hardware configuration, and robot runtime contracts remain unchanged |

### Key Changes (V5.2.13 - Gemini 3 Runtime Compatibility):
| Component | Change |
|---|---|
| `ninja_core/gemini_runtime.py` | **NEW** - Provides bounded REST generation for Gemini 3 models with `thinkingLevel=low`, explicit output limits, safe errors, and blocking network work moved off the asyncio event loop |
| `ninja_core/init_tool.py` | Validates the selected model with a minimal generation request before saving the new key/model pair |
| `ninja_core/ninja_agent.py` | Uses the compatibility path for Gemini 3 text, audio, and code operations; older models retain the legacy SDK path with an explicit request timeout |
| Runtime diagnostics | Chat and server startup identify the configured model, and failed requests return a visible model-specific response while keeping API keys out of logs |

### Code IDE Assistant Compatibility (2026-05-17):
| Area | Contract |
|---|---|
| Robot profile use | The Ninja Code Assistant may read `robot_info` as context for future Tire/Humanoid/Spider Blockly rules, but `robot_info` remains a read-only BLE service command. |
| Runtime safety | Assistant comments and explanations are browser-side Python comments only; they must not change `execute`, `save_action`, `stop`, or runtime pipeline behavior. |
| API key privacy | User BYO AI provider keys are handled by the browser Code IDE session and must not be stored in NinjaRobotPi0 config, action records, or BLE payloads. |
| Generated code compatibility | Blockly-generated Python still targets the existing GPIO-first wrapper APIs such as `robot.servos.move_pin()` and `robot.servos.move_pins()`. |

### Required Setup:
```bash
uv run pi0buzzer init 17
uv run pi0disp init              # First-time display setup
uv run pi0servo calib 20  # Repeat for each servo
uv run ninja_core config import
```

### 1.2 Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each library has a single, well-defined responsibility
2. **Dependency Injection**: Hardware dependencies (e.g., `pigpio.pi`) are passed to constructors
3. **Configuration over Code**: Hardware settings live in `config.json`, not hardcoded
4. **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Libraries provide sensible defaults if configuration is missing
5. **Testability**: Libraries can be imported and tested without full hardware
6. **Dual Connectivity**: Commands can arrive via BLE or Web, routed through Dispatcher

### 1.3 Dependency Graph

            break
        elif key:
            print(f"Pressed: {key}")
        time.sleep(0.1)
finally:
    kb.cleanup()
```

**Thread Safety:** Not thread-safe (use from main thread only)

---

#### 3.1.3 `service_manager.py`

**Module:** `ninja_utils.service_manager`

##### Class: `ServiceManager`

Manages the systemd service for automatic startup.

### 3.2 pi0buzzer

**Purpose:** Non-blocking passive buzzer driver with musical note support, sound queue, and interactive TUI

**Dependencies:** `pigpio`, `click`, `ninja_utils` (optional — library works standalone without it)

**Location:** `pi0buzzer/src/pi0buzzer/`

**Hardware Interface:** GPIO PWM (software PWM via pigpio)

#### 3.2.1 `notes.py` — Note Frequency Constants

**Module:** `pi0buzzer.notes`

Single source of truth for all musical note data. Used by both `pi0buzzer` and `ninja_core/robot_sound.py`.

**Exports:**
- `NOTES` (dict[str, int]): Named note frequencies C3–B7 (e.g. `{"A4": 440, "C5": 523}`)
- `KEYBOARD_MAP` (dict[str, str]): Keyboard key → note name mapping for interactive piano
- `EMOTION_SOUNDS` (dict[str, list]): 14 emotion sound sequences (happy, sad, exciting, etc.)
- `DEMO_SONG` (list): Twinkle Twinkle Little Star melody
- `get_emotion_names() -> list[str]`: Sorted list of available emotion names

---

#### 3.2.2 `core/driver.py` — Buzzer Class

**Module:** `pi0buzzer.core.driver`

##### Class: `Buzzer(Actuator)`

Non-blocking passive buzzer driver implementing the `Actuator` interface. Sounds are played in a dedicated background worker thread.

**Constructor:**
```python
def __init__(self, pin: int, pi: Optional[pigpio.pi] = None, volume: int = 128)
```

**Parameters:**
- `pin` (int): GPIO pin number (BCM)
- `pi` (pigpio.pi, optional): Shared pigpio connection. If `None`, creates one internally.
- `volume` (int): PWM duty cycle 0–255 (default 128 = 50%)

**Actuator Interface Methods:**

| Method | Description | Blocking |
|---|---|---|
| `initialize()` | Starts background worker, sets pin mode. Idempotent. | No |
| `execute(command: dict)` | Queues `{"frequency": Hz, "duration": sec}` for playback | No |
| `off()` | Drains queue, stops worker, silences buzzer | No |

**Additional Methods / Properties:**

| Method / Property | Description |
|---|---|
| `play_sound(frequency, duration)` | Legacy compatibility — delegates to `execute()` |
| `queue_pause(duration)` | Queues a silent pause between notes |
| `volume` (property) | Get/set PWM duty cycle (0–255, clamped) |
| `is_initialized` (property) | Whether the buzzer is initialized |
| `__enter__` / `__exit__` | Context manager support |

**Key Design:**
- **Frequency validation:** Clamped to 20–20,000 Hz
- **Re-initialization guard:** `initialize()` is idempotent (no duplicate workers)
- **Queue-based pauses:** `"__pause__"` sentinel handled in worker thread
- **Queue drain:** `off()` clears pending sounds before stopping

**Usage:**
```python
import pigpio
from pi0buzzer.core.driver import Buzzer

pi = pigpio.pi()
buzzer = Buzzer(pin=17, pi=pi)
buzzer.initialize()

buzzer.play_sound(440, 0.5)  # A4 note, 0.5s — returns immediately
buzzer.off()
pi.stop()
```

**Context Manager Usage:**
```python
with Buzzer(pin=17) as buzzer:
    buzzer.play_sound(440, 0.5)
```

---

#### 3.2.3 `core/music.py` — MusicBuzzer Class

**Module:** `pi0buzzer.core.music`

##### Class: `MusicBuzzer(Buzzer)`

Extends `Buzzer` with named note playback, songs, emotions, and interactive keyboard piano.

**Constructor:**
```python
def __init__(self, pin: int, pi: Optional[pigpio.pi] = None, volume: int = 128)
```

**Inherits:** All `Buzzer` methods

**Methods:**

| Method | Parameters | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `play_note(note_name, duration)` | `"C4"`, `0.3` | Play named note (case-insensitive). Non-blocking. |
| `play_song(song)` | `[("C4", 0.3), ("pause", 0.1), ...]` | Queue note sequence. Non-blocking. |
| `play_named_song(name)` | `"happy_birthday"`, `"jingle_bells"`, etc. | Queue one of the built-in Blockly melodies. Non-blocking. |
| `play_emotion(name)` | `"happy"`, `"sad"`, etc. | Play predefined emotion sound. Non-blocking. |
| `play_demo()` | — | Play built-in Twinkle Twinkle Little Star |
| `play_music()` | — | Interactive keyboard piano (stdin-based) |

**Built-in Song Names:** `happy_birthday`, `jingle_bells`, `twinkle_twinkle_little_star`, `head_shoulders_knees_and_toes`

**Usage:**
```python
from pi0buzzer.core.music import MusicBuzzer

with MusicBuzzer(pin=17) as buzzer:
    buzzer.play_emotion("happy")
    buzzer.play_named_song("jingle_bells")
    buzzer.play_song([
        ("C4", 0.3), ("E4", 0.3), ("G4", 0.3), ("C5", 0.6),
    ])
```

**Backward Compatibility:** `from pi0buzzer.driver import MusicBuzzer` still works via the compatibility shim. This is the import path used by `ninja_core/hal.py`.

---

#### 3.2.4 `config/config_manager.py` — BuzzerConfigManager

**Module:** `pi0buzzer.config.config_manager`

##### Class: `BuzzerConfigManager`

Manages buzzer configuration stored as JSON. Matches the pattern used by `pi0disp` and `pi0servo`.

**Constructor:**
```python
def __init__(self, config_path: Optional[str] = None)
```
- Defaults to `buzzer.json` in the current working directory.

**Methods:**

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `load()` | Load config from JSON (falls back to defaults on missing/corrupt file) |
| `save()` | Save current config to JSON |
| `get_pin() / set_pin(pin)` | Get/set GPIO pin (validates 0–27) |
| `get_volume() / set_volume(vol)` | Get/set volume (validates 0–255) |
| `export_config(path)` | Export config to another file |
| `import_config(path)` | Import config from another file |
| `init_config(pin)` | Set pin and save (used by CLI `init` command) |

### 3.3 pi0vl53l0x

**Purpose:** Robust driver for VL53L0X Time-of-Flight distance sensor

**Dependencies:** `pigpio` (optional, RPi only), `click`, `ninja_utils`

**Location:** `pi0vl53l0x/src/pi0vl53l0x/`

**Hardware Interface:** I2C (default address: 0x29, bus: 1)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **V5.2.3 REBUILD**: The pi0vl53l0x library was completely rebuilt with a new architecture:
> - **Thread-safe I2C** via `threading.Lock` plus a whole-measurement transaction lock — safe for concurrent `DistanceMonitor` and Blockly `robot.distance.read()` use
> - **Hardened initialization** — firmware boot polling (up to 1.0s) prevents "returns 0 after reboot"
> - **Automatic retry** with exponential backoff (10→20→50ms) and bus recovery
> - **V2 offset bug fix** — `get_data()` now stores true raw value before offset correction
> - **Health check + reinitialize** for runtime recovery without reboot

#### 3.3.1 `core/i2c.py`

**Module:** `pi0vl53l0x.core.i2c`

##### Class: `I2CBus`

Thread-safe I2C bus wrapper with automatic retry and bus recovery.

**Constructor:**
```python
def __init__(
    self,
    pi: pigpio.pi,
    bus: int = 1,
    address: int = 0x29,
    max_retries: int = 3,
)
```

**Parameters:**
- `pi` (pigpio.pi): Shared pigpio connection
- `bus` (int): I2C bus number (default: 1)
- `address` (int): 7-bit I2C address (default: 0x29)
- `max_retries` (int): Max retries per operation (default: 3)

**Key Methods:**

| Method | Returns | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `read_byte(register)` | `int` | Read single byte |
| `write_byte(register, value)` | `None` | Write single byte |
| `read_word_big_endian(register)` | `int` | Read 16-bit word (byte-swap) |
| `write_word_big_endian(register, value)` | `None` | Write 16-bit word (byte-swap) |
| `read_block(register, count)` | `list[int]` | Read block of bytes |
| `write_block(register, data)` | `None` | Write block of bytes |
| `close()` | `None` | Close I2C handle (safe to call multiple times) |

**Thread Safety:** Individual I2C operations are serialized via `threading.Lock`. Full ranging transactions are serialized by `VL53L0X._measurement_lock`, so a background monitor read and a Blockly/user-code read cannot interleave the sensor's register sequence.

**Retry Strategy:** Exponential backoff (10ms → 20ms → 50ms). On exhaustion, attempts bus recovery by closing and reopening the I2C handle.

##### Exception: `I2CError`

**Key Constants:**
- `SYSRANGE_START = 0x00` — Trigger measurement
- `RESULT_RANGE_STATUS = 0x14` — Result range status
- `IDENTIFICATION_MODEL_ID = 0xC0` — Model ID register (expected: 0xEE)
- `DEVICE_ADDRESS = 0x29` — Default I2C address

**Constructor:**
```python
def __init__(
    self,
    pi: pigpio.pi,
    i2c_bus: int = 1,
    i2c_address: int = 0x29,
    debug: bool = False,

  - `easing` (str | Callable): Easing function name or callable (default: `ease_in_out_cubic`)
  - `force` (bool): If `True`, send PWM even for very small movements (prevents limpness)
- **Returns:** `True` if completed, `False` if aborted

**Usage:**
```python
import pigpio
from pi0servo import ServoGroup, ConfigManager

pi = pigpio.pi()

# Load calibrations
manager = ConfigManager()
manager.load()
calibrations = {20: manager.get_calibration(20), 21: manager.get_calibration(21)}

# Create group
group = ServoGroup(pi, pins=[20, 21], calibrations=calibrations)

# Move with per-servo speeds
group.move_all_sync([45, -30], speed_mode=["F", "S"], easing="ease_in_out_cubic")

#### 3.6.2 `dispatcher.py` (New Phase 2)

**Module:** `ninja_core.dispatcher`

**Purpose:** The central nervous system for routing versioned commands from multiple sources (Web, BLE) to the HAL, agent, and Blockly execution runtime while preserving a single active execution lifecycle.

##### Class: `CommandDispatcher` (Singleton)

**Constructor:**
`__init__(self, hal: Optional[HardwareAbstractionLayer] = None, runtime_pipeline: RuntimePipeline | None = None)`

**Methods:**

**`register_listener(self, callback: Callable[[dict], Any]) -> None`**
- Registers a callback to receive broadcast messages (e.g., AI responses).
- Used by `NinjaBLEService` and `WebSocketManager`.

**`attach_agent(self, agent: Any) -> None`**
- Connects the `NinjaAgent` instance for AI command processing.

**`attach_runtime_pipeline(self, runtime_pipeline: RuntimePipeline) -> None`**
- Attaches the native/Blockly ownership coordinator and forwards it to `SafeExecutor`.

**`attach_action_library(self, action_library: ActionLibrary, native_movement_names: Iterable[str] | None = None) -> None`**
- Connects the persistent saved Blockly action library and the native movement-name set used for duplicate-name rejection.

**`attach_faces(self, faces: AnimatedFaces) -> None`**
- Shares the native face engine with Blockly user code so idle animation and uploaded expressions cannot draw concurrently.

**`async execute_action_chain(self, action_chain: Iterable[dict], request_id: str | None = None) -> dict`**
- Builds replay Python from saved Blockly actions and executes it through the same SafeExecutor/runtime-pipeline path as a BLE `execute` upload.

**`async handle_command(self, source: str, command: dict) -> dict`**
- Main entry point for all commands.
- **Parameters:**
    - `source`: "ble" or "web"
    - `command`: JSON dictionary (e.g., `{"type": "chat", ...}`)
- **Returns:** JSON-compatible result dictionary.

**Supported Command Types:**
1. **`chat`** -> Routes to `NinjaAgent.process_command()`. Broadcasts user message and AI response.
2. **`hal`** -> Routes to `HardwareAbstractionLayer`.
3. **`execute`** -> Compiles Blockly-generated Python through `SafeExecutor`; after compilation succeeds, `RuntimePipeline.begin_blockly()` stops native idle/sound/servo actions before user code starts. The dispatcher then broadcasts `execute_received`, `execution_status: started`, and keeps all follow-up events on the same `request_id`.
4. **`save_action`** -> Validates and persists a complete Code IDE Blockly action. The dispatcher broadcasts `action_save_status: saved`, `overwritten`, `conflict`, or `error` and refreshes AI capabilities after a successful save or overwrite.
5. **`stop`** -> Sends a cooperative stop signal to `SafeExecutor.stop()`, calls `RuntimePipeline.abort_blockly()`, broadcasts `execution_status: stop_requested` for the active request, and restores native idle behavior.

**Execution Lifecycle Guarantees:**
- Every execution request carries a `request_id`.
- Only one execution may be active at a time.
- If a second `execute` arrives while code is already running, the dispatcher emits an `execute_rejected` error for the new request **without** clearing the original active request.
- If generated code fails syntax compilation, the dispatcher emits `execute_received`, `execution_status: error`, and `error.code: syntax_error` with structured line details, but it does not emit a false `started` status.
- Blockly ownership starts only after syntax compilation succeeds. Syntax failures therefore do not stop native idle animation or direct web-interface behavior.
- On completion, `RuntimePipeline.complete_blockly(status)` restores native idle unless the successful Blockly program intentionally requested a display hold with `robot.display.clear()`.
- Stop requests from BLE, Stop Robot, or Code IDE disconnect use `RuntimePipeline.abort_blockly()` and always return to native idle.
- Completion, failure, stop, chat explanation, and execution-log events all stay correlated to the active request.
- Saved Blockly action replay is intentionally routed through `execute_action_chain()` instead of directly importing Python from disk, so replay keeps syntax validation, stop handling, runtime ownership, and execution feedback behavior identical to a live Code IDE upload.

**Usage:**
```python
dispatcher = CommandDispatcher(hal)
result = await dispatcher.handle_command("ble", {"type": "chat", "text": "Hi"})
```

- `distance_monitor` (DistanceMonitor | None)
- `runtime_pipeline` (RuntimePipeline | None)
- `first_interaction` (bool): Whether first user request received
- `has_greeted` (bool): Whether welcome greeting played

##### Function: `lifespan(app: FastAPI)`

FastAPI lifespan context manager for startup/shutdown.

**Startup:**
1. Loads config
2. Initializes HAL
3. Creates `RuntimePipeline`, `ActionLibrary`, and `CommandDispatcher`
4. Initializes faces, sound, movement, distance monitor
5. Attaches shared faces/sound and saved-action library to `RuntimePipeline`, Dispatcher, and NinjaAgent
6. Attempts to initialize NinjaAgent (catches `MissingAPIKeyError`)
7. Calls `setup_network_and_display(app)` for ngrok

**Shutdown:**
1. Stops all background threads (faces, distance monitor)
2. Shuts down HAL
3. Kills ngrok process

##### Function: `setup_network_and_display(app: FastAPI)`

Sets up ngrok in a background thread, caches tunnel/LAN URLs and displays a reconnect QR only while no browser owns the session.

##### Helper Functions

**`handle_first_interaction(app_state: AppState) -> None`**
- Reclaims native runtime ownership if Blockly display hold is active, then clears QR code and shows idle face on first user request

**`trigger_welcome(app_state: AppState) -> None`**
- Plays happy face + sound for 3 seconds on authorized events-socket connection; tracked browser-generation context and guarded centering prevent stale greetings after disconnect.

**`safety_check(app_state: AppState) -> bool`**
- Returns True if distance <= 50mm

**`execute_action_plan(app_state: AppState, action_plan: dict) -> None`**
- Executes AI agent's action plan (face, sound, native movement, saved Blockly action)
- Runs face and sound in parallel threads
- Waits for movements to complete
- Replays `action_chain` entries through `CommandDispatcher.execute_action_chain()` so saved Blockly actions reuse SafeExecutor, stop handling, and native/Blockly ownership restoration

**`reclaim_native_runtime(app_state: AppState) -> None`**
- Lets direct web/native interaction interrupt Blockly ownership.
- Stops active Blockly execution if needed, clears display-hold state, and resumes native idle face.
- Called before direct native movement, expression, and sound API actions.

#### 3.6.10 `safe_executor.py` (New Phase 4)

**Module:** `ninja_core.safe_executor`

**Purpose:** Provides a sandboxed environment for executing user-generated or AI-generated Python code safely.

##### Class: `SafeExecutor`

**Constructor:**
```python
def __init__(
    self,
    hal: HardwareAbstractionLayer,
    on_print: Callable[[str], None] = None,
    faces: AnimatedFaces | None = None,
    runtime_pipeline: RuntimePipeline | None = None,
)
```

**Parameters:**
- `hal`: Hardware Abstraction Layer for accessing `robot` API.
- `on_print`: Callback for capturing `print()` output (e.g., for broadcasting to WebSockets).
- `faces`: Optional shared native `AnimatedFaces` instance.
- `runtime_pipeline`: Optional native/Blockly ownership coordinator.

**Methods:**

**`execute(code: str, on_complete: Callable[[dict], None] = None, on_start: Callable[[], None] = None) -> dict`**
- Executes Python code in a restricted sandbox.
- **Parameters:**
    - `code`: Python code string.
    - `on_complete`: Async callback fired when execution completes/fails.
    - `on_start`: Optional callback fired after successful compilation and before the user-code thread starts.
- **Returns:** `{"status": "started" | "success" | "error" | "stopped", "message": str}`
- **Safety Features:**
    - Blocks: `os`, `sys`, `subprocess`, `open`, `eval`, `exec`, `__import__`.
    - Provides: `robot`, `time`, `math`, `print`, `check_stop()`.
    - Compiles code before starting the execution thread. Syntax failures return `error_code: "syntax_error"` and `syntax_error` details without calling hardware stop cleanup, because no user code has run yet.
    - Uses `on_start` for the native-to-Blockly pipeline switch so syntax errors do not interrupt native idle behavior.
    - Builds `RobotWrapper` with shared faces and runtime-pipeline hooks when provided by `web_server.py`.

**`stop() -> None`**
- Signals the current execution to stop.

**Usage:**
```python
from ninja_core.safe_executor import SafeExecutor

executor = SafeExecutor(hal, on_print=lambda msg: print(f"[LOG] {msg}"))
result = executor.execute("robot.buzzer.play('happy')")
```

---

#### 3.6.11 `runtime_pipeline.py`

**Module:** `ninja_core.runtime_pipeline`

**Purpose:** Coordinates the two runtime pipelines:

1. **Native pipeline**: Direct interaction through the Raspberry Pi web interface, idle face animation, web-triggered expressions, sounds, and movements.
2. **Blockly pipeline**: Uploaded code received from the NinjaRoboticPlatform Code IDE over BLE.

##### Class: `RuntimePipeline`

```

**Methods:**
- `attach_hal(hal)`: Updates the shared HAL reference after startup wiring.
- `attach_faces(faces)`: Shares the native face engine with Blockly execution.
- `attach_sound(sound)`: Shares the native sound player with Blockly execution.
- `begin_blockly()`: Switches to Blockly mode, stops native face animation, stops native sound playback, and aborts active native servo motion.
- `mark_display_hold()`: Records that Blockly `robot.display.clear()` intentionally wants the screen to stay blank after successful execution.
- `complete_blockly(status)`: Returns to native idle after Blockly completion, except for successful display-clear holds.
- `abort_blockly()`: Cancels Blockly ownership and immediately restores native idle. Used by Stop Robot and BLE disconnect.
- `reclaim_native()`: Lets a direct web/native action take control back from a Blockly hold.

**Ownership Rules:**
- Direct Raspberry Pi web-interface actions preserve all native `ninja_core` functions.
- A BLE Blockly upload temporarily stops native idle/action output before running user code.
- Normal completion restores idle face after expressions and other transient Blockly actions.
- `robot.display.clear()` is the intentional exception: on success it keeps the display blank until the next Blockly upload, Stop Robot, Disconnect, or direct web/native interaction.

#### 3.6.12 `action_library.py`

**Module:** `ninja_core.action_library`

**Purpose:** Persistent library for complete Blockly actions uploaded from the NinjaRoboticPlatform Code IDE. Saved records live in `ninja_actions/*.json` at the project runtime root and include the generated Python code, Blockly workspace metadata, manifest, user-facing name, filesystem-safe slug, and timestamps.

##### Class: `ActionLibrary`

**Constructor:**
```python
def __init__(self, root: Path | str = ACTION_LIBRARY_PATH)
```

**Methods:**
- `list_actions() -> list[dict]`: Loads valid `ninja-action-v1` records.
- `list_names() -> list[str]`: Returns user-facing saved action names for the AI prompt.
- `find_action(name_or_slug: str) -> dict | None`: Finds by normalized name or slug.
- `get_action(name_or_slug: str) -> dict`: Returns a saved action or raises `ActionNotFoundError`.
- `ensure_name_available(name, native_movement_names=(), allow_existing_action=False) -> tuple[str, str]`: Rejects empty/oversized names and conflicts with native config movement names or existing saved Blockly actions.
- `save_action(name=..., code=..., workspace_state=..., manifest=..., native_movement_names=..., overwrite=False) -> dict`: Validates imports/syntax, stores the record atomically, and returns the saved record. `overwrite=True` may replace a saved Blockly action but never a native config movement.
- `build_replay_code(action_chain) -> str`: Builds SafeExecutor-compatible Python that replays one or more saved Blockly actions with bounded repetitions and cooperative `check_stop()` calls.

**Validation Rules:**
- Action names are normalized with Unicode NFKC, trimmed, case-folded for conflict checks, and limited to 80 UTF-8 bytes.
- Slugs are filesystem-safe. Non-ASCII-only names fall back to a stable hash slug.
- Saved Python must parse/compile and may only import `time`, `math`, `random`, or `ninja_core`.
- Code size is limited to 128 KiB per action.
- Name conflicts are decided by the robot, not by the browser, so native movements and saved Blockly actions share one action namespace.
- Saved Blockly action conflicts return `can_overwrite: true`; native movement conflicts return `can_overwrite: false`.
- Long-running saved Blockly actions remain cooperative. New web-agent messages request `SafeExecutor.stop()`, abort active servo motion, stop display/sound/face output, and wait briefly before the next action plan runs. Non-cooperative Python loops that never call `check_stop()` cannot be safely killed in-thread and must be stopped through Stop Robot or server restart.

---



#### 3.6.13 `api_wrappers.py` (New Phase 4)

**Module:** `ninja_core.api_wrappers`

**Purpose:** High-level Python API wrappers that simplify robot control for user-generated code. Exposed as `robot` in the SafeExecutor.

##### Class: `RobotWrapper`

**Constructor:**
```python
def __init__(
    self,
    hal: HardwareAbstractionLayer,
    cooperative_sleep: Callable[[float], None] | None = None,
    faces: AnimatedFaces | None = None,
    runtime_pipeline: RuntimePipeline | None = None,
)
```

**Attributes:**
- `buzzer` (BuzzerWrapper): Sound control.
- `display` (DisplayWrapper): Screen control.
- `distance` (DistanceWrapper): Sensor reading.
- `servo` (ServoArrayWrapper): Legacy direct servo access (indexable 0-7 or batch).
- `servos` (ServoArrayWrapper): GPIO-first servo access used by Blockly motion generators.

##### Class: `ServoArrayWrapper`

**Methods:**
- `__getitem__(index)`: Access individual servo (e.g., `robot.servo[0]`).
- `move_pin(pin: int, angle: float, speed_mode: str = "M", easing: str = "ease_in_out_cubic") -> bool`: Move one configured GPIO servo using pi0servo speed modes (`F`, `M`, `S`). Angles are clamped to `-90..90`.
- `move_pins(movements: dict[int, float], speed_mode: str = "M", per_servo_speeds: dict[int, str] | None = None, easing: str = "ease_in_out_cubic", force: bool = True) -> bool`: Move multiple GPIO servos together. Unknown GPIO pins raise `ValueError`; invalid speed modes fall back to `M`.
- `move_all(angles: list, duration: float)`: Legacy batch movement for older code. Blockly v2 generators should use `move_pin()` or `move_pins()` instead.
- `center()`: Reset all servos to center (`0°` in the Blockly-facing `-90..90` range).

**Blockly Motion API Notes:**
- The NinjaRoboticPlatform Code IDE generator version `web-blockly-v2` emits GPIO-first calls:
  - Set GPIO: `robot.servos.move_pin(20, 45, speed_mode="F")`
  - Center GPIO: `robot.servos.move_pin(20, 0, speed_mode="M")`
  - Set All GPIO Servos: `robot.servos.move_pins({20: 0, 21: 0, 22: 0, 23: 0, 24: 0, 25: 0, 26: 0, 27: 0}, speed_mode="M")`
  - Move Multiple Servos: `robot.servos.move_pins({20: 45, 21: -30}, per_servo_speeds={20: "F", 21: "S"})`
- Blockly motion speed is not a delay. Use the Code IDE Time Pause block, which generates cooperative `sleep(seconds)`, when a pause is needed between actions.

**Blockly Text & Sound API Notes:**
- The Code IDE Text category now provides Show Text, which accepts standard Blockly text inputs such as `text` and `text_join` and generates `robot.display.text(message, scroll=..., duration=...)`.
- Static Show Text uses shared centered rendering; scrolling Show Text uses the Pi ticker runtime and stops cleanly on normal completion, Stop Robot, or Disconnect.
- The Code IDE Sound category now provides Play Music, which generates `robot.buzzer.play_song("<built-in-name>")`.
- Built-in Blockly song names are `happy_birthday`, `jingle_bells`, `twinkle_twinkle_little_star`, and `head_shoulders_knees_and_toes`.

##### Class: `BuzzerWrapper`

**Methods:**
- `play(name: str)`: Plays a predefined sound. Valid: `happy`, `sad`, `exciting`, `angry`, `confusing`, etc.
- `play_song(name: str)`: Plays a built-in melody. Valid: `happy_birthday`, `jingle_bells`, `twinkle_twinkle_little_star`, `head_shoulders_knees_and_toes`.
- `tone(freq: int, duration: float)`: Plays raw frequency.

##### Class: `DisplayWrapper`

**Methods:**
- `image(name: str)`: Shows asset image. Valid: `star`, `heart`.
- `text(content, scroll: bool = False, duration: float = 2.0, speed: float = 2.0, language: str = "auto", font_size: int = 32, color=(255,255,255), bg_color=(0,0,0))`: Shows static centered text or scrolling ticker text for a cooperative display duration.
- `clear(hold: bool = True)`: Clears the display. During Blockly execution, the default `hold=True` marks the runtime pipeline so the blank display remains after successful code completion until native ownership is reclaimed.
- `stop()`: Stops any active scrolling-text ticker without clearing the current display frame.

##### RobotWrapper Runtime Notes

- `expression(name, duration=2.0)` uses the shared native `AnimatedFaces` engine when available, preventing the idle face thread from drawing over uploaded expressions.
- `request_stop()` stops shared faces, active scrolling text, Blockly-triggered sound playback, and active servo motion without powering down the display, allowing `RuntimePipeline` to restore idle cleanly.

##### Class: `DistanceWrapper`

**Methods:**
- `read() -> int`: Returns distance in millimeters.

### 3.7 ninja_ble

**Purpose:** Bluetooth Low Energy GATT server for wireless control and AI chat. Enables direct, zero-network-setup communication with the robot.

#### 3.7.2 BLE Service Specification

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| **Service Name** | Configurable via `config.json["bluetooth"]["name"]` (default: `NinjaRobot`) |
| **Service UUID** | `00000001-710e-4a5b-8d75-3e5b444bc3cf` |
| **Transport Contract** | `blockly-v1` events over raw JSON for small payloads and BLE transport v2 chunking for large payloads |

**Characteristics:**
| Name | UUID | Properties | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Command | `00000002-710e-4a5b-8d75-3e5b444bc3cf` | Write, WriteWithoutResponse | Receives JSON commands or transport-v2 chunk packets |
| Response | `00000003-710e-4a5b-8d75-3e5b444bc3cf` | Read, Notify | Sends JSON responses and chunked runtime feedback |
| Command Status | `00000004-710e-4a5b-8d75-3e5b444bc3cf` | Read, Notify | Holds the latest cached command response requested by `get_command_response`; used by Chrome/Web Bluetooth clients when a notification is missed |

#### 3.7.3 JSON Protocol

**Chat Command (AI Chat):**
```json
{"type": "chat", "text": "Tell me a joke"}
```

**Chat Response (AI Response):**
```json
{"type": "chat", "sender": "ninja", "text": "Why did the robot go on vacation?..."}
```

**HAL Command (Hardware Control):**
```json
{"type": "hal", "command": "execute", "payload": {"servos": {"angles": [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]}}}
{"type": "hal", "command": "execute", "payload": {"buzzer": {"frequency": 440, "duration": 0.5}}}
```

**Execute Command (Blockly IDE):**
```json
{
  "type": "execute",
  "request_id": "execute-123",
  "manifest": {
    "protocol_version": "blockly-v1",
    "generator_version": "web-blockly-v2",
    "workspace_format": "blockly-json"
  },
  "workspace_state": {"blocks": []},
  "code": "from ninja_core import robot\nrobot.expression('happy')\n"
}
```

**Save Action Command (Blockly IDE):**
```json
{
  "type": "save_action",
  "request_id": "save-action-123",
  "manifest": {
    "protocol_version": "blockly-v1",
    "generator_version": "web-blockly-v2",
    "workspace_format": "blockly-json"
  },
  "name": "NinjaV5 wave and smile",
  "workspace_state": {"blocks": []},
  "code": "from ninja_core import robot\nrobot.expression('happy')\n"
}
```

The robot persists this as a complete Blockly action in `ninja_actions/`. If `name` conflicts with a native `config.json` movement or another saved Blockly action, the robot returns `action_save_status` with `status: "conflict"` and `code: "action_name_conflict"`. The Code IDE treats the robot as authoritative, keeps the naming dialog open, and prompts the user to enter a different action name or cancel. The lower-level `overwrite` flag remains guarded by `ActionLibrary` for maintenance clients, but native config movements can never be overwritten by saved Blockly actions.

**Command Response Readback (BLE Recovery):**
```json
{
  "type": "get_command_response",
  "request_id": "save-action-123"
}
```

`NinjaBLEService` caches final `action_save_status` events by `request_id` for a short TTL and writes the cached event to the Command Status characteristic when this command is received. If the save is still running, the status characteristic contains `{"type":"command_response_status","status":"pending"}`; if no cached response is known, it contains `status: "missing"`. The Response characteristic remains the live notification/event stream, while Command Status is the deterministic readback path for Chrome/Web Bluetooth clients.

**Stop Command:**
```json
{"type": "stop", "request_id": "stop-123", "reason": "user_stop"}
```

`reason` may also be `"disconnect"` when the Code IDE is closing a BLE session. Both forms abort Blockly ownership and restore native idle behavior.

**ACK Envelope (Transport v2):**
```json
{"type": "ack", "transfer_id": 7, "phase": "data", "seq": 3, "status": "ok"}
```

**Runtime Event Types:**
- `execute_received`
- `execution_status`
- `execution_log`
- `action_save_status`
- `command_response_status` (transport readback only)
- `chat`
- `error`

`error` events may include a `details` object. Blockly syntax errors use this to report `line`, `offset`, `text`, and `message` so the education IDE can display precise feedback.

#### 3.7.4 Key Classes

**`NinjaBLEService`** (`service.py`)
```python
class NinjaBLEService:
    def __init__(self, dispatcher: CommandDispatcher, service_name: str = "NinjaRobot", robot_profile: dict | None = None): ...
    async def start(self): ...          # Start GATT server & advertising
    async def stop(self): ...           # Stop server
    async def on_broadcast(self, message: dict): ...  # Send BLE notification
    async def _publish_cached_command_response(self, request_id: str): ...  # Status readback
```

**Usage (from `web_server.py`):**
```python
from ninja_ble.service import NinjaBLEService
from ninja_core.config import build_robot_profile
from ninja_core.dispatcher import CommandDispatcher

dispatcher = CommandDispatcher(hal)
ble_service = NinjaBLEService(
    dispatcher,
    service_name=config.bluetooth.name,
    robot_profile=build_robot_profile(config),
)
asyncio.create_task(ble_service.start())
```

**`robot_info` Profile Event:**
```json
{
  "type": "robot_info",
  "service_name": "Classroom Ninja 1",
  "robot_type": "humanoid",
  "robot_type_label": "Humanoid",
  "hardware_configuration": {
    "servos": {
      "gpio_pins": [12, 13, 18],
      "pins": {"left": 12},
      "calibration": {"12": {"center_pulse": 1500}}
    }
  }
}
```

`robot_info` is handled inside `NinjaBLEService` and does not enter the dispatcher or HAL command path. If profile serialization fails, the service still returns the existing name-only payload with a non-secret `profile_error`.

#### 3.7.5 Dependencies

| Package | Version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `bless` | ≥0.2.6 | BLE GATT server |
| `bleak` | ≥0.21.0, <1.0.0 | BLE backend |
| `dbus-fast` | ≥1.86.0 | BlueZ D-Bus (Linux) |

#### 3.7.6 Testing with nRF Connect

1. Start server: `uv run ninja_core server`
2. Open nRF Connect → Scan → Connect to the configured robot name (default: `NinjaRobot`)
3. Subscribe to Response characteristic (`...0003`)
4. Write to Command characteristic (`...0002`):
   ```json
   {"type": "chat", "text": "Hello!"}
   ```
5. Verify notification received with AI response

## 4. Configuration System

### 4.1 Configuration Files

**`config.json`** (Main Config)
- **Location:** Project root
- **Format:** JSON
- **Managed by:** `ninja_core.config`
- **Contains:** All hardware settings, BLE name, movements, API keys, and the selected Gemini model

**`servo.json`** (Servo Calibration)
- **Location:** Project root or `pi0servo/`
- **Format:** JSON array of servo objects
- **Managed by:** `pi0servo` calibration tool
- **Imported into:** `config.json` via `config import-all`

**`buzzer.json`** (Buzzer Configuration)
- **Location:** Project root (generated by `pi0buzzer init`)
- **Format:** `{"pin": <int>, "volume": <int 0-255>}`
- **Managed by:** `pi0buzzer init`, `pi0buzzer config`, `pi0buzzer buzzer-tool`
- **Imported into:** `config.json` via `config import-all`

### 4.2 Configuration Workflow

1. **Initial Setup:**
   ```bash
   uv run pi0buzzer init 26
   uv run pi0servo calib 17  # Repeat for all servos
   uv run ninja_core config import-all
   ```

2. **Set Gemini API Key and Model:**
   ```bash
   uv run ninja_core config set-key gemini YOUR_KEY
   ```
   The command retrieves the available model catalog from Google, displays Gemini models that support `generateContent`, prompts for one model, and runs a bounded minimal generation probe before saving. Thinking-model validation can take up to 60 seconds. If discovery, validation, or selection fails, the previous configuration is left unchanged.

3. **Optional: Set BLE Name**
   ```bash
   uv run ninja_core config set-name "Desk Robot A"
   ```

4. **Verify:**
   ```bash
   cat config.json
   ```

### 4.3 Example `config.json`

```json
{
    "servos": {
        "pins": {},
        "calibration": {

                "angle_range": 180
            }
        }

## 8. AI-Assisted Development and Local Wiki

All supported AI coding tools must follow [`AGENTS.md`](../../../../../AGENTS.md). The canonical local knowledge base is [`Wiki/NinjaRobotPi0_Wiki`](../../../../../ninjarobot_pi0_Wiki/README.md).

### 8.1 Tool adapters

| Tool | Project instruction entry | Reusable workflow discovery |
|---|---|---|
| OpenAI Codex | `AGENTS.md` | `.agents/skills/` |
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` | `.claude/skills/` wrappers to `.agents/skills/` |
| Google Antigravity | `GEMINI.md` and `.agents/rules/` | `.agents/skills/` and `.agents/workflows/` |
| Cursor | `AGENTS.md` and `.cursor/rules/` | `.agents/skills/` |

The adapters only route each tool to the same maintained instructions. They must not become separate copies of the development policy.

### 8.2 Retrieval before development

Use the `robot-wiki-query` skill before substantial planning, diagnosis, implementation, or review involving architecture, APIs, hardware, protocols, deployment, calibration, or known problems. The workflow must:

1. check whether project-owned source snapshots have drifted;
2. search the wiki and inspect page/source status;
3. cite relevant local pages and registered sources;
4. verify current software behavior against code and tests;
5. report stale, conflicting, missing, or unreviewed evidence.

Wiki retrieval is read-only and never authorizes GPIO, actuator, power, or other hardware operations.

### 8.3 Wiki maintenance after changes

Project documents registered as wiki evidence are mapped in `Wiki/NinjaRobotPi0_Wiki/project-sources.toml`. After a feature or document update, run:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/robot-wiki-maintain/scripts/wiki_source_sync.py --check
```

Review every mismatch. After the canonical project document is fact-checked, use `robot-wiki-maintain` to synchronize the selected source, normalize it, prepare a source-hashed wiki change plan, and show the plan diff. Semantic wiki changes require explicit approval before apply.

After an approved apply, review affected sourced pages and run normal wiki lint. Use strict lint for stable or release-quality pages. Report any deferred source drift, approval, semantic review, or Raspberry Pi validation honestly.

The complete integration rationale and rollout checklist are in [`WikiIntegrationWorkflowPlan.md`](../../../../../WikiIntegrationWorkflowPlan.md).

## Appendix B: Common Issues

**Issue:** `Could not connect to pigpiod daemon`  
**Solution:** `sudo pigpiod`

**Issue:** `ImportError: No module named 'ninja_utils'`  
**Solution:** `uv pip install -e ./ninja_utils`

**Issue:** Display shows nothing  
**Solution:** Check SPI enabled in `raspi-config`

**Issue:** Distance sensor returns 8190  
**Solution:** Check I2C wiring and run `sudo i2cdetect -y 1`

**Issue:** Gemini model lookup fails during key setup

**Solution:** Check internet access and API-key permissions, then rerun `uv run ninja_core config set-key gemini YOUR_KEY`. A failed lookup does not replace the existing Gemini key or model.

**Issue:** Chat remains on “thinking” or the agent returns no answer after selecting a Gemini 3 model

**Solution:** Confirm the server console names the expected model. Gemini 3 models use the bounded REST compatibility path with low thinking because the installed `google-generativeai` SDK cannot express current thinking controls. Rerun `uv run ninja_core config set-key gemini YOUR_KEY`; the selected model must now complete a validation request before it is saved. Runtime failures identify the model and failure category in the console without logging the API key.

## Historical phase: opt-in Spider OTTO waypoint library (before automatic import)

This section records the earlier offline-pack task. Its unchanged-controller, opt-in import and cancellation statements apply to that phase only; the current implementation is the automatic native catalog described at the beginning of this candidate manual. Current playback rejects unknown GPIOs, validates all waypoints/type scope, polls callbacks at step boundaries and stops advancing on driver abort. The original pack/generator remain unchanged; the installed resource and import adaptation add the document's Poweroff and rename runtime entries.

The repository now contains `ninja_core/movements/spider_otto.json`, generated offline by `scripts/build_spider_movements.py`. Nineteen named entries cover sixteen OTTO movement functions plus selected directional variants; 565 steps use only the existing `moves` and `speed` fields. Existing `per_servo_speeds` remains supported by the unchanged controller and is tested separately. Source-ID-to-BCM mapping is S0→25, S1→24, S2→27, S3→26, S4→21, S5→20, S6→23, S7→22. The owner-supplied nominal conversion is q−90; Pi0 mounting direction remains unverified. No source S2 reversal or EEPROM trim is inferred for Pi0.

See `DevelopmentPlanDoc/SpiderBuildinMovements.md` for current schema examples, all movements, import-preview instructions and fidelity limits. The pack is a repository asset, not automatically loaded or installed as package data. It does not replace the live config or supply calibration. Existing movement functions, driver code, APIs, calibration and OTTO reference sources are unchanged.

Current movement steps use velocity-derived independent durations, wait for the slowest servo and choose easing by step position. They do not implement explicit pauses, exact periods or shared-time oscillator phases. Source jump/scared waits are omitted; hello is a documented partial adaptation of buggy state-dependent helpers. Unknown GPIO targets are silently omitted by the existing controller, and abort_check is not polled/forwarded; the pack does not improve cancellation guarantees.

`DevelopmentPlanDoc/Pi0BuildinMovementsRefinement.md` is a future-design reference only. It proposes a separate versioned registry/controller with timed poses, cancellable dwells, analytic oscillators, strict limits, shared monotonic time and exclusive output ownership. It does not add current fields or endpoints.

Host validation: 71 targeted pytest cases passed (Spider pack, config and API wrappers); Ruff checks/formatting passed for the two new Python files; generator --check and protected-core verification passed. No installation, physical robot execution or dynamics simulation occurred. Measured mapping/orientation, clearance, power, timing, balance and stop behavior remain pending owner-controlled Pi validation.
