# NinjaRobotPi0 development log

## 2026-10-08 — compatibility rather than exact tool versions

## Software compatibility policy

The installer checks capabilities, not exact OS/Node/uv release equality:

- Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, Linux `aarch64`, Debian-based Raspberry Pi OS (`ID=debian`
  or `raspbian`), and a normal user are required. No release-codename allowlist remains.
  Bookworm and Trixie are the reference targets; other releases are not automatically
  hardware-qualified merely because they pass preflight.
- Python 3.10+ is needed by existing runtime annotations (for example `ninja_core/config.py`
  and `pi0servo/core/servo.py`). Optional wiki development requires Python 3.11+.
  Existing metadata still says >=3.9; this installer check reflects the stricter runtime
  requirement without changing the robot packages. Locked dependencies remain authoritative.
- Node 20.19+ within 20.x, or Node >=22.12.0, matches the committed Vite 7/plugin engines.
  Node 24.21.0 qualifies. npm must be executable; `npm ci` and the build still have to succeed.
- uv has no exact-version gate. Its `sync --help` must expose `--locked`, `--no-dev`,
  `--python`, `--directory`, and `--all-extras`. uv 0.9.26 satisfies this and passed an
  offline host `sync --locked --no-dev --dry-run` against the existing lockfile.
  The capability probe alone does not certify every future uv version; real locked sync
  must succeed, with its original error preserved if it fails.
- Compatible tools on PATH are reused before compatible private tools. Missing/incompatible
  tools use checksum-verified fallback downloads. Download pins are not installed-version
  requirements. System tools and calibration files are retained. The existing pigpio daemon
  qualification remains separate and unchanged.

`./install.sh --check` stays read-only. Missing `.venv/bin/python` or `.venv/bin/ninja_core`
still means installation is incomplete: run `./install.sh`, wait for **Software installed**,
then run `./install.sh --check`. Publish/fetch this change before retrying on the Pi.
No physical Pi, hardware, account, or network-service acceptance is implied by host checks.

日本語：OS のコードネームと Node/uv の完全一致チェックを廃止し、実際の必要条件を確認します。
互換性のある既存ツールを再利用します。`.venv` がない場合は `./install.sh` による導入が必要です。
繁體中文：取消 OS 代號及 Node/uv 的固定版本比對，改查實際需求並重用相容工具。
缺少 `.venv` 時仍須執行 `./install.sh` 完成安裝；實機驗收另行進行。
简体中文：取消 OS 代号及 Node/uv 的固定版本比对，改查实际需求并复用兼容工具。
缺少 `.venv` 时仍须运行 `./install.sh` 完成安装；实机验收单独进行。


## 2026-10-08 — actionable installation recovery

Clarified the difference between inspection, Git update and actual installation. Added exact
version/path diagnostics and retry commands, robust timeout/exec handling, and installer failure
stage reporting with original exit status and temporary-lock cleanup. Tests preserve calibration
and prove check is read-only. README provides fast-forward default-HEAD steps for detached clones.
No robot core change, hardware activation or publication; real Pi follow-up remains pending.
日本語：導入診断と復旧手順を改善。校正・コアは維持、実機検証は別途必要です。
繁體中文：改善安裝診斷與復原步驟，保留校準與核心，實機驗證仍待完成。


## 2026-10-08 — Trixie installer rejection

The owner reported Debian 13/trixie on Zero 2 W. Both bootstrap and shared Python preflight
still enforced the earlier Bookworm-only requirement. Extended the allowlist to Bookworm/Trixie,
retained hardware/architecture/user/distribution guards, added release regression cases and
Python 3.11/3.13 CI. Updated current README/manuals/wiki without changing robot core or locks.
Host validation is recorded in `docs/validation/TrixieSupport-2026-10-08.md`; real Pi validation
and publication of this correction remain pending.

日本語：Trixie 拒否の原因を修正。コア・ロックは維持、実機検証は未実施です。
繁體中文：修正 Trixie 版本檢查拒絕問題，核心與鎖檔未更動，實機驗證仍待完成。


## 2026-10-08 — implementation audit and public README

Reviewed the approved upgrade against Pi5 terminal onboarding and README. Fixed pulse-alias
validation, credential first-write privacy, malformed/stale progress, real resume, retry/reuse flow,
worker platform enforcement, installer path/version/record handling, and wiki setup isolation.
Rewrote README with step-by-step curl/onboarding/testing, explicit runtime ngrok/servo boundaries,
and labelled multilingual summaries. Protected runtime/driver files remain unchanged.
New complete manual versions and source-grounded page reviews retain historical evidence.
Actual checks: see `docs/validation/UpgradeAudit-2026-10-08.md`; no physical Pi/account test or push.

日本語：導入・初期設定・Wiki を監査修正し、README を再構成。実機検証・公開は別途必要です。
繁體中文：完成安裝、初始設定與 Wiki 稽核修正並重寫 README；實機驗證與發布仍待完成。

## 2026-10-07 — approved installation, onboarding, wiki, and visual upgrade

Added a default-branch curl bootstrap, pinned/hash-checked software installer, and guided
Pi0 onboarding around existing interactive hardware tools and existing Gemini/ngrok helpers.
Moved the populated wiki to `ninjarobot_pi0_Wiki`; retained old raw originals and unmodified
page reviews. Added explicit wiki setup/prepare, read-only query/check, immutable manual versions,
current source/implementation mapping, policy/skill adapters, and regression checks.
Applied Pi5's navy/cyan design to Pi0's existing routes and controls, retaining their contracts.

Host validation and exact counts are recorded in `docs/validation/UpgradeValidation-2026-10-07.md`.
Core/driver source hashes and existing metadata/lockfiles are checked against the captured baseline.
No Raspberry Pi or live account test was run; owner final manual acceptance remains pending.
No commit/push/deployment was performed for this upgrade. Published curl endpoint acceptance remains
pending publication. Existing 2026-10-07 semantic reviews were preserved unless page content changed.

# Development Log

## 2026-09-01: Gemini 3.7 Flash No-Response Diagnosis And Runtime Fix ✓
- **Action**: Diagnosed and fixed the apparent no-response behavior after selecting `gemini-3.7-flash`.
- **Root Cause**:
  - `config.json` correctly contained `gemini-3.7-flash`, and the API key was present.
  - Google listed version `3.7-flash-08-2026` with `generateContent`, but a minimal request through the installed deprecated `google-generativeai 0.8.5` SDK timed out. The same key and network returned `200 OK` from `gemini-3-flash-preview`.
  - A direct REST request to Gemini 3.7 Flash succeeded with `thinkingLevel=low`. The installed legacy SDK has no thinking-configuration type, so its default Gemini 3 request could remain pending long enough to appear silent.
  - The project had no durable application log file. Direct chat errors were printed only to its console, and no `ninjarobot` systemd journal entries were available in the inspected environment.
- **Fix**:
  - Added `gemini_runtime.py`, which provides bounded, key-redacted REST generation for Gemini 3 models, applies the supported low thinking level, caps output, and moves blocking URL work to `asyncio.to_thread`.
  - Preserved the legacy SDK path for older Gemini models while adding an explicit request timeout.
  - Routed text chat, audio, code generation, explanation, and analysis through the appropriate bounded path without changing action-plan parsing or hardware execution.
  - Added a minimal generation probe before a selected model is persisted. Discovery, validation, timeout, or cancellation failures leave the previous key/model bytes unchanged.
  - Added model-specific startup and error diagnostics without logging API-key values.
- **Validation**:
  - Focused Gemini/config/init/agent tests passed (`39 passed`), Ruff passed, and all affected Python modules compiled.
  - The full root test suite passed (`104 passed`; 31 existing third-party DBus deprecation warnings), `git diff --check` passed, and the `ninja_core` source/wheel build included both Gemini modules. The build reported only the existing setuptools license-table deprecation warning.
  - A hardware-free live `NinjaAgent.process_command()` request using the saved `gemini-3.7-flash` model returned `READY` with a valid action plan. The full project prompt took approximately 35 seconds, confirming the model works but remains slower than the legacy default.
  - A subsequent 30-second validation probe timed out because Gemini 3.7 latency varied between calls, so the selection probe was aligned with the bounded 60-second runtime limit to avoid rejecting a working but slow model.
  - Earlier isolation checks showed Gemini 3.7 Flash timing out without thinking controls, succeeding with low thinking, and the legacy default returning `200 OK` using the same key/network.
  - No Raspberry Pi hardware, GPIO, servo, display, buzzer, or sensor validation was performed.
- **Files Modified**: `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/gemini_runtime.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/init_tool.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/__main__.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/ninja_agent.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/web_server.py`, `tests/test_gemini_runtime.py`, `tests/test_init_tool.py`, `tests/test_ninja_agent_model.py`, `DevelopmentGuide.md`, `InstallationGuide.md`, `ninja_core/README.md`, and `DevelopmentLog.md`.

## 2026-09-01: Gemini API Key Validation And Model Selection ✓
- **Action**: Replaced the fixed Gemini model setup path with API-key-specific model discovery and interactive selection for `uv run ninja_core config set-key gemini ...` and the guided `init-tool`.
- **Details**:
  - Added paginated Google Gemini model discovery over the official models REST endpoint, with `generateContent` filtering, deterministic ordering, finite timeouts, safe error messages, and no API key in request URLs or displayed errors.
  - Added backward-compatible `gemini.model` configuration. Existing files without this section retain the previous `gemini-3-flash-preview` behavior until setup is rerun.
  - Saved the Gemini key and selected model together only after successful discovery and selection; invalid keys, network failures, empty results, and cancellation leave the previous configuration unchanged.
  - Updated `NinjaAgent` initial creation and capability refresh to use the configured model while leaving prompts, chat/audio/code processing, action plans, BLE, web, and hardware behavior unchanged.
  - Preserved generic immediate-save behavior for non-Gemini `config set-key` services and preserved the existing web API key endpoint contract.
- **Validation**:
  - `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests -q` passed (`96 passed`; third-party `dbus_next` deprecation warnings only).
  - Standalone regression suites passed for `pi0buzzer` (`65 passed`), `pi0disp` (`57 passed`), and `pi0servo` (`82 passed`). The unrelated `pi0vl53l0x` suite produced 53 passing test progress markers but did not exit during teardown and was interrupted; no VL53L0X code changed.
  - `.venv/bin/ruff check ninja_core/src tests`, focused Ruff format checks for the new module/tests, and `git diff --check` passed.
  - A network smoke check using an intentionally invalid placeholder key reached Google's models endpoint and returned the expected redacted invalid-key error. No configured/local API key was used.
  - A single repository-wide pytest collection remains unsupported because package-local `tests` modules collide and the wiki package is not installed in the root environment; suites were therefore run from their owning package contexts.
  - No Raspberry Pi Zero 2W or robot hardware validation was performed. The configuration-only Pi smoke test remains pending and must not start the server or energize hardware.
  - Wiki source mirrors were synchronized for `src-20260822-developmentguide`, `src-20260822-developmentlog`, and `src-20260822-readme-3`. Source normalization, semantic plan generation, and wiki lint remain pending because the installed `uv` is older than the wiki's required version and the root environment lacks the wiki's `rich` dependency. Pre-existing README and Installation Guide mirror drift remains deliberately unsynchronized.
- **Files Modified**: `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/gemini_models.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/config.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/init_tool.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/__main__.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/ninja_agent.py`, `tests/test_gemini_models.py`, `tests/test_ninja_agent_model.py`, `tests/test_config.py`, `tests/test_init_tool.py`, `README.md`, `ninja_core/README.md`, `DevelopmentGuide.md`, `InstallationGuide.md`, `DevelopmentLog.md`, and the deterministically synchronized wiki source snapshots/catalog records for the three source IDs above.

## 2026-09-01: Developer Quality Tooling And Codex MCP Setup ✓
- **Action**: Added reproducible Python quality tools and prepared the local Codex CLI with semantic code-navigation and current-library documentation MCP servers without changing robot runtime behavior.
- **Details**:
  - Added `pytest` and `ruff` to the root `dependency-groups.dev` lock-backed development environment.
  - Installed and initialized Serena 1.7.0 with its LSP backend; Serena migrated `.serena/project.yml` to its current schema while retaining Python analysis and project-root indexing.
  - Registered Serena with Codex's `codex` context and current-directory project activation, and registered Context7 through its maintained npm MCP package.
  - Added explicit MCP startup timeouts in the user-level Codex configuration because Serena's cold startup exceeds Codex's default ten-second window on this machine.
- **Why**: Make the upcoming Gemini configuration work testable and lintable from the repository environment, while giving Codex symbol-aware repository navigation and current third-party library documentation.
- **Validation**: `uv run pytest tests/test_config.py tests/test_init_tool.py -q` passed (`11 passed`); focused `uv run ruff check` passed. Direct MCP JSON-RPC initialization and `tools/list` probes passed for Serena (`23` tools) and Context7 (`resolve-library-id`, `query-docs`). No Raspberry Pi or robot hardware validation was required or performed because this change only affects developer tooling.
- **Files Modified**: `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `.serena/project.yml`, `DevelopmentGuide.md`, and `DevelopmentLog.md`. User-level installations/configuration were also updated under the uv tool directory, `~/.serena/`, and `~/.codex/config.toml`.

## 2026-09-01: Cross-Tool Local Wiki Development Workflow ✓
- **Action**: Integrated `Wiki/NinjaRobotPi0_Wiki` into the NinjaRobotV5 AI-assisted development workflow without changing robot runtime behavior.
- **Details**:
  - Added canonical `AGENTS.md` instructions with evidence retrieval, conflict handling, physical safety, documentation, validation, and wiki-maintenance gates; retained `AGENT.md` as a legacy pointer.
  - Added Claude Code, Google Antigravity, and Cursor adapters that route to the same canonical policy.
  - Added portable `robot-wiki-query` and `robot-wiki-maintain` skills, Claude wrappers, and Antigravity workflows.
  - Added `project-sources.toml` and a deterministic source-mirror checker so project document drift is visible before wiki knowledge is updated.
  - Refined the driver, documentation, and Raspberry Pi validation skills to use wiki evidence and report maintenance state.
  - Added `WikiIntegrationWorkflowPlan.md` and documented the workflow in `README.md`, `DevelopmentGuide.md`, and the embedded wiki README/AGENTS files.
- **Why**: Give Codex, Claude Code, Google Antigravity, and Cursor the same local source of truth and prevent stale or conflicting documents from being silently copied into future robot work.
- **Validation**: Documentation/skill validation, source-mirror checks, wiki lint/tests, and parent Git inclusion checks are recorded in the task handoff. No Raspberry Pi validation was required because no robot code, configuration, deployment, or hardware behavior changed.
- **Files Modified**: `AGENTS.md`, `AGENT.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.agents/`, `.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `README.md`, `DevelopmentGuide.md`, `DevelopmentLog.md`, `WikiIntegrationWorkflowPlan.md`, and workflow files under `Wiki/NinjaRobotPi0_Wiki/`.

## 2026-05-17: Code IDE Assistant Compatibility Note ✓
- **Action**: Synchronized NinjaRobotV5 documentation with the browser-side Ninja Code Assistant enhancement.
- **Details**:
  - Confirmed no NinjaRobotV5 runtime code change was required for the first assistant enhancement phase.
  - Documented that browser-side assistant comments/explanations must not alter `execute`, `save_action`, `stop`, or runtime pipeline behavior.
  - Reaffirmed that BYO AI provider API keys are not robot configuration and must not be stored in `config.json`, saved action records, or BLE payloads.
  - Reaffirmed that future Tire/Humanoid/Spider-specific assistant generation should use `robot_info` only as read-only profile context unless a later robot-side contract explicitly changes this.
- **Validation**: Paired platform validation passed in `NinjaRoboticPlatform` with `npm run lint`, `npm run test` (`92 passed`), `npm run build`, and browser smoke checks. RobotV5 code was not modified in this phase.
- **Files Modified**: `DevelopmentGuide.md`, `DevelopmentLog.md`, `InstallationGuide.md`.

## 2026-05-16: Guided Initialization And Robot Profile Sync ✓
- **Action**: Added the NinjaRobotV5 guided initialization flow and BLE robot profile synchronization for the NinjaRoboticPlatform Code IDE.
- **Details**:
  - **Config model**: Added `robot_type` (`tire`, `humanoid`, `spider`), validation helpers, sanitized hardware profile serialization, and explicit `hardware_configuration.servos.gpio_pins`.
  - **Interactive setup**: Added `uv run ninja_core init-tool` with menu actions for Gemini API key, ngrok token, robot rename, robot type, hardware import, sanitized config display, server start, and exit.
  - **BLE profile**: Extended `NinjaBLEService` `robot_info` responses with robot type and sanitized hardware configuration while preserving name-only fallback behavior for older IDEs and profile serialization failures.
  - **ngrok setup**: Extracted lightweight ngrok token helpers so token setup can run without initializing the web server or robot hardware.
- **Validation**: `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 uv run --with ruff ruff check ninja_core/src ninja_ble/src tests` passed. `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 PYTHONPATH=ninja_ble/src:ninja_core/src:ninja_utils/src:pi0buzzer/src:pi0disp/src:pi0servo/src uv run --with pytest --with pillow python -m pytest tests` passed (`76 passed`).
- **Files Modified**: `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/config.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/init_tool.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/ngrok_config.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/__main__.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/web_server.py`, `ninja_ble/src/ninja_ble/service.py`, `tests/test_config.py`, `tests/test_init_tool.py`, `tests/test_ble_service.py`, `DevelopmentGuide.md`, `InstallationGuide.md`, `DevelopmentLog.md`.

## 2026-05-06: BLE Save Status Readback Refinement ✓
- **Action**: Hardened BLE Save to Robot confirmations so a successful Blockly action save on the Pi no longer appears as `Response timeout for action_save_status` when Chrome misses the notification event.
- **Implementation**:
  - **Command response cache**: `NinjaBLEService` now caches final `action_save_status` events by `request_id` for deterministic readback.
  - **Status characteristic**: Added Command Status characteristic `00000004-710e-4a5b-8d75-3e5b444bc3cf` for browser polling via `get_command_response`.
  - **Notification sizing**: Outbound BLE notifications now chunk above a conservative 160-byte payload threshold instead of relying on the previous 500-byte single-notification limit.
  - **Compatibility**: The existing Response characteristic remains the live notification stream for older Code IDE clients.
- **Validation**: `uv run --with pytest pytest tests` passed (`67 passed`). `uv run --with ruff ruff check ninja_ble/src/ninja_ble/service.py tests/test_ble_service.py tests/test_chunking.py` passed. Repo-wide `uv run --with pytest pytest` and `uv run --with ruff ruff check .` still encounter unrelated pre-existing sibling-package collection/lint issues in `pi0*` test folders.
- **Files Modified**: `ninja_ble/src/ninja_ble/service.py`, `tests/test_ble_service.py`, `README.md`, `DevelopmentGuide.md`, `DevelopmentLog.md`.

## 2026-04-30: Saved Action Overwrite And Agent Interruption Refinement ✓
- **Action**: Refined saved Blockly action collision handling and web-agent interruption behavior for long-running saved actions.
- **Implementation**:
  - **Protected overwrite**: `ActionLibrary.save_action(..., overwrite=True)` can replace existing saved Blockly actions while preserving native `config.json` movements from overwrite.
  - **Collision metadata**: `action_save_status` now includes `can_overwrite` and `overwritten` so the Code IDE can distinguish saved-action conflicts from protected native movement conflicts.
  - **BLE response fallback**: `NinjaBLEService` now sends a save-action response fallback from the dispatcher result, preventing browser-side `action_save_status` timeouts during collision handling.
  - **Agent interruption**: New web-agent messages call a cooperative interruption path that stops active SafeExecutor code, aborts servos, stops face/sound output, and serializes action-plan execution with an async lock before running the new command.
  - **Safety limit**: Non-cooperative Python loops that never reach `check_stop()` are not force-killed in-thread; the server returns a safety warning instead of starting a second robot action on top of the first.
- **Validation**: `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 uv run --with ruff ruff check ninja_core/src ninja_ble/src tests` passed. `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 PYTHONPATH=ninja_ble/src:ninja_core/src:ninja_utils/src:pi0buzzer/src:pi0disp/src:pi0servo/src uv run --with pytest --with pillow python -m pytest tests` passed (`64 passed`).

## 2026-04-29: Saved Blockly Action Library Refinement ✓
- **Action**: Added a persistent saved-action pipeline so complete Blockly programs uploaded from the NinjaRoboticPlatform Code IDE can be named, stored on the robot, and replayed by the NinjaRobotV5 AI agent.
- **Implementation**:
  - **Action library**: Added `ninja_core.action_library.ActionLibrary`, storing validated `ninja-action-v1` records in `ninja_actions/*.json` with generated Python, Blockly workspace metadata, manifest, normalized name, slug, and timestamps.
  - **Robot-authoritative conflicts**: The Pi now rejects action names that conflict with native `config.json` movements or existing saved Blockly actions and returns `action_save_status` with `code: action_name_conflict`.
  - **BLE command contract**: `CommandDispatcher` now handles `save_action`, broadcasts saved/conflict/error status events, and refreshes agent capabilities after a successful save.
  - **AI replay path**: `NinjaAgent` now exposes saved Blockly action names in its prompt and may return `action_chain`; `web_server.execute_action_plan()` replays that chain through `CommandDispatcher.execute_action_chain()` and the SafeExecutor/runtime-pipeline path.
  - **Documentation**: Updated `README.md` and `DevelopmentGuide.md` with the saved action library, BLE command/event contract, replay behavior, and validation rules.
- **Validation**: `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 uv run --with ruff ruff check ninja_core/src ninja_ble/src tests` passed. `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 PYTHONPATH=ninja_ble/src:ninja_core/src:ninja_utils/src:pi0buzzer/src:pi0disp/src:pi0servo/src uv run --with pytest --with pillow python -m pytest tests` passed (`62 passed`).
- **Files Modified**: `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/action_library.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/contracts.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/dispatcher.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/ninja_agent.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/web_server.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/__main__.py`, `tests/test_action_library.py`, `tests/test_contracts.py`, `tests/test_dispatcher.py`, `README.md`, `DevelopmentGuide.md`, `DevelopmentLog.md`.

## 2026-04-23: BLE Robot Naming Refinement ✓
- **Action**: Added persistent Bluetooth naming support so each NinjaRobotV5 can advertise a user-defined discovery name instead of relying on the shared default.
- **Details**:
  - **Config model**: Added `bluetooth.name` to `config.json`, BLE-safe normalization, and `set_robot_name()` in `ninja_core.config`.
  - **CLI command**: Added `uv run ninja_core config set-name "<name>"` to save a custom robot name for future BLE sessions.
  - **BLE runtime**: Updated `NinjaBLEService` to advertise the configured name through both Bless server startup and the compact BlueZ advertisement fallback.
  - **Web status**: Updated `web_server.py` to start BLE with the saved name and report the configured name from `/ble/status`.
  - **Documentation**: Added Installation Guide section `7.7 Name your robot` and refreshed the Development Guide config, CLI, BLE, and config.json reference sections.
- **Validation**: `uv run --with ruff ruff check ninja_core/src ninja_ble/src tests` passed. `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 PYTHONPATH=ninja_ble/src:ninja_core/src:ninja_utils/src:pi0buzzer/src:pi0disp/src:pi0servo/src uv run --with pytest --with pillow python -m pytest tests/test_ble_service.py tests/test_config.py` passed (`7 passed, 1 skipped`). `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 PYTHONPATH=ninja_ble/src:ninja_core/src:ninja_utils/src:pi0buzzer/src:pi0disp/src:pi0servo/src uv run --with pytest --with pillow python -m pytest tests` passed (`49 passed, 1 skipped`).
- **Files Modified**: `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/config.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/__main__.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/web_server.py`, `ninja_ble/src/ninja_ble/service.py`, `tests/test_ble_service.py`, `tests/test_config.py`, `InstallationGuide.md`, `DevelopmentGuide.md`, `DevelopmentLog.md`.

## 2026-04-23: Blockly Text & Music Contract Refinement ✓
- **Action**: Added Pi-side text/music wrapper APIs for Blockly and synchronized the runtime documentation with the new Show Text and Play Music blocks.
- **Details**:
  - **Display text API**: Added shared centered-text rendering and `robot.display.text(...)` with static/scrolling modes, cooperative duration handling, and ticker cleanup on stop or disconnect.
  - **Built-in songs**: Added `happy_birthday`, `jingle_bells`, `twinkle_twinkle_little_star`, and `head_shoulders_knees_and_toes` to `pi0buzzer.notes`, plus `MusicBuzzer.play_named_song()` and `robot.buzzer.play_song()`.
  - **Stop cleanup**: `RobotWrapper.request_stop()` now stops active scrolling text before native idle is restored, matching the Code IDE Stop Robot and Disconnect contract.
  - **Documentation**: Updated `DevelopmentGuide.md` with V5.2.8 notes, the new buzzer/display APIs, and Blockly text/music examples.
- **Validation**: `uv run --with ruff ruff check ninja_core/src pi0disp/src pi0buzzer/src tests pi0disp/tests pi0buzzer/tests` passed. `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 PYTHONPATH=ninja_ble/src:ninja_core/src:ninja_utils/src:pi0buzzer/src:pi0disp/src:pi0servo/src uv run --with pytest --with pillow python -m pytest tests` passed (`45 passed, 1 skipped`). `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 PYTHONPATH=src uv run --with pytest --with pillow python -m pytest tests` passed in `pi0disp` (`57 passed`). `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 PYTHONPATH=src uv run --with pytest python -m pytest tests` passed in `pi0buzzer` (`65 passed`). Paired Code IDE validation also passed with focused Blockly tests, full `npm test -- --run`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build`.
- **Files Modified**: `pi0disp/src/pi0disp/effects/text_ticker.py`, `pi0disp/src/pi0disp/cli/text_cmd.py`, `pi0disp/tests/test_text_ticker.py`, `pi0buzzer/src/pi0buzzer/notes.py`, `pi0buzzer/src/pi0buzzer/core/music.py`, `pi0buzzer/tests/test_music.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/api_wrappers.py`, `tests/test_api_wrappers.py`, `DevelopmentGuide.md`, `DevelopmentLog.md`.

## 2026-04-23: Blockly GPIO Motion Contract Refinement ✓
- **Action**: Added GPIO-first servo wrapper APIs for Blockly-generated motion code and synchronized the Pi runtime docs with the Code IDE motion changes.
- **Details**:
  - **GPIO servo API**: `ServoArrayWrapper` now exposes `move_pin(pin, angle, speed_mode="M")` and `move_pins({pin: angle}, per_servo_speeds={...})` for GPIO-addressed motion.
  - **Speed-mode routing**: Wrapper calls normalize `F`/`M`/`S` speed modes, clamp Blockly angles to `-90..90`, reject unknown GPIO pins, and forward synchronized targets to pi0servo `move_all_sync()`.
  - **Compatibility**: Existing native/direct APIs such as `robot.servo[n]`, `robot.servos.move_all()`, and other `ninja_core` wrappers remain available for Raspberry Pi web-interface and legacy script use.
  - **Protocol default**: Updated the Pi-side default Blockly generator manifest to `web-blockly-v2`, while still accepting sender-provided manifest overrides.
  - **Documentation**: Updated `DevelopmentGuide.md` with V5.2.7 notes and the `web-blockly-v2` GPIO/speed/multi-servo examples.
- **Validation**: `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 uv run --with ruff ruff check ninja_core/src tests` passed. `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 PYTHONPATH=ninja_ble/src:ninja_core/src:ninja_utils/src:pi0buzzer/src:pi0servo/src uv run --with pytest --with pillow python -m pytest tests` passed (`41 passed, 1 skipped`). Paired Code IDE validation also passed with focused Blockly tests, full `npm test -- --run`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build`.
- **Files Modified**: `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/api_wrappers.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/contracts.py`, `tests/test_api_wrappers.py`, `tests/test_contracts.py`, `DevelopmentGuide.md`, `DevelopmentLog.md`.

## 2026-04-23: Native/Blockly Dual Pipeline Refinement ✓
- **Action**: Fixed Blockly BLE expression/display ownership conflicts by separating native robot behavior from uploaded Blockly execution.
- **Root Cause**: Blockly execution could create or use display/sound actions independently from the native idle pipeline, allowing uploaded expressions or display clears to race with the web server's idle face animation.
- **Details**:
  - **RuntimePipeline**: Added a native/Blockly ownership coordinator that stops native face, sound, and servo output when valid Blockly code starts.
  - **Shared face engine**: `SafeExecutor` and `RobotWrapper` now reuse the native `AnimatedFaces` instance so `robot.expression("angry")` does not overlap with idle animation.
  - **Display clear hold**: `robot.display.clear()` now keeps the display blank after successful Blockly completion until native interaction, the next upload, Stop Robot, or Disconnect restores ownership.
  - **Stop/disconnect restore**: Dispatcher stop handling aborts Blockly ownership and resumes native idle; direct web actions reclaim native mode before running.
  - **Documentation**: Updated `DevelopmentGuide.md` with the dual-pipeline contract, affected APIs, and BLE stop/disconnect behavior.
- **Validation**: `PYTHONPATH=ninja_ble/src:ninja_core/src:ninja_utils/src:pi0buzzer/src:pi0servo/src uv run --with pytest --with pillow python -m pytest tests` passed (`37 passed, 1 skipped`). `uv run --with ruff ruff check ninja_core/src tests` passed. Paired IDE validation in `NinjaRoboticPlatform` also passed with `npm test -- --run` and `npm run lint`.
- **Files Modified**: `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/runtime_pipeline.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/api_wrappers.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/dispatcher.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/robot_sound.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/safe_executor.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/web_server.py`, `tests/test_api_wrappers.py`, `tests/test_dispatcher.py`, `tests/test_runtime_pipeline.py`, `DevelopmentGuide.md`, `DevelopmentLog.md`.

## 2026-04-22: Documentation Synchronization Audit ✓
- **Action**: Reviewed `DevelopmentGuide.md` and the affected `pi0vl53l0x/README.md` against the latest Blockly-driven distance-sensor concurrency and recovery changes.
- **Details**:
  - **VL53L0X docs**: Updated `pi0vl53l0x` feature and API documentation to describe transaction-level ranging locks, thread-safe `reinitialize()`, and shared use by the background monitor plus Blockly `robot.distance.read()`.
  - **Core docs**: Corrected `DistanceMonitor.get_continuous_distance()` unavailable-reading semantics from `0` to `-1`, matching the current runtime behavior before `DistanceWrapper` converts invalid Blockly reads to `9999`.
  - **Test inventory**: Updated `pi0vl53l0x` test counts from 60 to 61 and documented the new transaction-lock sensor test.
- **Validation**: Performed a line-by-line documentation audit with Serena symbol/pattern checks against `VL53L0X`, `DistanceMonitor`, and `DistanceWrapper`; followed with stale-text searches for outdated thread-safety and test-count claims. `uv run --with ruff ruff check ninja_core/src pi0vl53l0x/src tests pi0vl53l0x/tests` passed.
- **Files Modified**: `DevelopmentGuide.md`, `pi0vl53l0x/README.md`, `DevelopmentLog.md`.

## 2026-04-22: VL53L0X Blockly Concurrency & Recovery Fix ✓
- **Action**: Fixed VL53L0X failures observed when Blockly code repeatedly called `robot.distance.read()` while the server's background distance monitor was also active.
- **Root Cause**: `I2CBus` serialized individual byte operations, but `VL53L0X.get_range()` and `get_data()` perform multi-step single-shot ranging transactions. The background monitor and Blockly user code could interleave register writes, causing I2C retries, bus recovery, invalid `-1` readings, and a permanently stopped monitor thread.
- **Details**:
  - **Measurement lock**: Added a `threading.RLock` around whole VL53L0X ranging transactions and runtime reinitialization/close.
  - **Monitor recovery**: `DistanceMonitor` now keeps running after transient I2C failures, marks cached distance unavailable, and attempts `sensor.reinitialize()` after repeated failures.
  - **Blockly safety fallback**: `robot.distance.read()` now returns the documented `9999` fallback for invalid or unavailable sensor data instead of returning `-1`, preventing failed reads from triggering near-obstacle branches.
  - **CLI lint cleanup**: Fixed unused imports in the VL53L0X CLI entrypoint so the expanded package lint gate is clean.
- **Validation**: `uv run --with ruff ruff check ninja_core/src pi0vl53l0x/src tests pi0vl53l0x/tests`, `PYTHONPATH=ninja_ble/src:ninja_core/src:ninja_utils/src uv run --with pytest --with pillow python -m pytest tests`, and `PYTHONPATH=pi0vl53l0x/src uv run --with pytest python -m pytest pi0vl53l0x/tests` passed.
- **Files Modified**: `pi0vl53l0x/src/pi0vl53l0x/core/sensor.py`, `pi0vl53l0x/src/pi0vl53l0x/__main__.py`, `pi0vl53l0x/src/pi0vl53l0x/cli/sensor_tool.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/perception.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/api_wrappers.py`, `pi0vl53l0x/tests/test_sensor.py`, `tests/test_api_wrappers.py`, `tests/test_perception.py`, `DevelopmentGuide.md`.

## 2026-04-21: Blockly Syntax Error Runtime Refinement ✓
- **Action**: Hardened Pi-side Blockly execution handling after a generated indentation error caused hardware cleanup even though user code never started.
- **Details**:
  - **Syntax preflight**: `SafeExecutor.execute()` now compiles code before starting the execution thread.
  - **Hardware safety**: Syntax failures return immediately without calling `robot.request_stop()`, preventing unnecessary display, buzzer, or servo shutdown.
  - **Structured errors**: `contracts.build_error_event()` can include structured `details`; `CommandDispatcher` broadcasts syntax error line data through the normal BLE feedback contract.
  - **Executor recovery**: Added tests proving valid code can run immediately after a syntax failure.
- **Validation**: `uv run --with ruff ruff check ninja_core/src tests` and `PYTHONPATH=ninja_ble/src:ninja_core/src:ninja_utils/src uv run --with pytest --with pillow python -m pytest tests/test_safe_executor.py tests/test_dispatcher.py tests/test_contracts.py` passed.
- **Files Modified**: `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/safe_executor.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/dispatcher.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/contracts.py`, `tests/test_safe_executor.py`, `tests/test_dispatcher.py`, `tests/test_contracts.py`, `DevelopmentGuide.md`.

## 2026-04-21: Blockly Runtime Reliability Refinement ✓
- **Action**: Closed the remaining Phase 5 classroom-reliability gaps identified during the secondary Blockly/BLE audit.
- **Details**:
  - **Request lifecycle fix**: `dispatcher.py` now preserves the active execution `request_id` when a second `execute` request is rejected, so stop/log/status/error broadcasts remain correlated to the original run.
  - **Runtime feedback fidelity**: Removed the 120-character execution-log truncation now that outbound BLE chunking handles large runtime feedback safely.
  - **Tests**: Added dispatcher coverage for rejected duplicate runs and full-length execution-log broadcasts.
  - **Documentation**: Updated `DevelopmentGuide.md` to document the versioned Blockly `execute`/`stop` contract, BLE transport-v2 ACK envelopes, and the event stream consumed by the IDE.
- **Validation**: `uv run --with ruff ruff check NinjaRobotV5/ninja_core/src NinjaRobotV5/tests` and targeted `pytest NinjaRobotV5/tests/test_dispatcher.py` passed.
- **Files Modified**: `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/dispatcher.py`, `tests/test_dispatcher.py`, `DevelopmentGuide.md`.

## 2026-02-26: Cross-Documentation Content Audit & Corrections ✓
- **Action**: Performed a full, line-by-line audit of `README.md`, `DevelopmentGuide.md`, and `InstallationGuide.md` to ensure all information perfectly matches the newly rebuilt V5 hardware libraries (`pi0servo`, `pi0disp`, `pi0vl53l0x`, and `pi0buzzer`).
- **Issues Found & Fixed**:
  - **InstallationGuide.md**: Corrected the display hardware specification from "240x240 pixels" to the accurate "240x320 pixels" across all three languages (English, Japanese, Traditional Chinese). 
  - **DevelopmentGuide.md**: Fixed the architecture dependency graph, correcting the pi0disp linkage. Removed duplicate lines in the ninja_utils API section. Verified all library API sub-sections (including `ninja_core`) against the actual source code, confirming that previous log updates had successfully kept the API references accurate.
  - **README.md**: Updated the OS compatibility badge, bumped the copyright year to 2026 in the translation sections, and ensured library feature descriptions correctly highlight the non-blocking architectures of the rebuilt libraries. 
- **Validation**: Manual reading, file structure comparisons, and `grep` verifications. All documentation files are now fully synchronized with the 5.3.0 codebase.
- **Files Modified**: `README.md`, `DevelopmentGuide.md`, `InstallationGuide.md`.

## 2026-02-26: DevelopmentGuide.md & InstallationGuide.md — pi0buzzer Section Updates ✓
- **Action**: Reviewed and updated all pi0buzzer-related content in `DevelopmentGuide.md` and `InstallationGuide.md` to reflect the rebuilt V1.0.0 library.
- **DevelopmentGuide.md changes**:
  - Replaced 3-file file tree with full 16-file modular structure (core/, config/, cli/, tests/, notes.py).
  - Updated dependency graph: `ninja_utils` now marked optional.
  - Rewrote section 3.2 from 2 subsections to 5: notes.py, Buzzer class, MusicBuzzer class, BuzzerConfigManager, CLI commands.
  - Fixed constructor signature: old `(pi, pin)` → new `(pin, pi, volume)`.
  - Corrected behavior: old "Blocking: Yes" → new "Non-blocking" for all methods.
  - Added new CLI commands: `play`, `info`, `config show/export/import`, `buzzer-tool`.
  - Updated `buzzer.json` format to include `volume` field.
- **InstallationGuide.md changes**:
  - Replaced `uv run pi0buzzer playmusic` with `uv run pi0buzzer play happy` in all 3 language sections (EN, JP, ZH).
- **Files Modified**: `DevelopmentGuide.md`, `InstallationGuide.md`.

## 2026-02-26: pi0buzzer Standalone Mode Fix & Minor Audit Findings ✓
- **Action**: Fixed critical `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ninja_utils'` when running pi0buzzer standalone (outside NinjaRobotV5 workspace). Applied conditional `try/except` imports to `core/driver.py`, `core/music.py`, and `config/config_manager.py` — matching the pattern established by `pi0disp` and `pi0servo`.
- **Details**:
  - **Actuator fallback**: When `ninja_utils` is absent, a minimal local `Actuator(ABC)` is defined inline.
  - **Logger fallback**: Falls back to standard `logging.getLogger(__name__)` when `ninja_utils.get_logger` is unavailable.
  - **pigpio fallback**: `pigpio = None` when not installed (for PC/Mac dev).
  - **`from __future__ import annotations`**: Added to `core/driver.py` and `core/music.py` so `pigpio.pi` type hints are lazily evaluated (prevents `AttributeError` when `pigpio = None`).
  - **F4**: `beep` CLI argument changed from `float` to `int` for frequency.
  - **F5**: `export_config()` now calls `save()` before `shutil.copy2()` to ensure in-memory changes are included.
- **Validation**: `ruff check` clean, 61/61 pytest tests pass.
- **Files Modified**: `core/driver.py`, `core/music.py`, `config/config_manager.py`, `__main__.py`, `RebuildPlan.md`.

## 2026-02-26: pi0buzzer Library Full Rewrite & ninja_core Integration ✓
- **Action**: Completely rebuilt the `pi0buzzer` library (Phase 8 of ProjectUpgradePlan). Replaced old blocking driver with a robust, architecture-aligned library featuring `Buzzer`, `MusicBuzzer`, `BuzzerConfigManager`, and an interactive TUI CLI (`buzzer-tool`).
- **Key Features**:
  - **Non-blocking Playback**: Background worker thread supports single tones, songs, and pauses safely alongside asyncio (`__pause__` support in queue).
  - **Shared Notes module**: `pi0buzzer.notes` unifies note frequencies, keyboard mappings, and `EMOTION_SOUNDS`.
  - **Config Management**: JSON configuration with validation, fallback defaults, and import/export capabilities.
  - **Interactive CLI**: Menu-driven `buzzer-tool` matching the `servo-tool` and `display-tool` paradigms, enabling hardware testing, config management, health-checks, and a live keyboard piano mode.
  - **100% Test Pass Rate**: 61/61 unit tests passing utilizing mocked pigpio.
- **Integration**: Refactored `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/robot_sound.py` to import `NOTES` and `EMOTION_SOUNDS` directly from `pi0buzzer.notes` (single source of truth), preserving the `RobotSoundPlayer` interface for backward compatibility.
- **Files Modified**: `pi0buzzer/` (full directory replacement), `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/robot_sound.py`, `ProjectUpgradePlan.md`, `pi0buzzer/RebuildPlan.md`.
- **Validation**: `uv run ruff check` passed clean on all files. 61 pytest checks succeeded. `buzzer.json` configuration tested locally via the CLI tools.


## 2026-02-25: InstallationGuide.md — Reorganize Calibration Sequence ✓
- **Action**: Reorganized sections 7 and 8 in all three languages (English, Japanese, Chinese) so all component setup/calibration happens **before** `ninja_core config import`.
- **New Flow**: 7.1 Display Setup → 7.2 Buzzer Setup → 7.3 Distance Sensor Test → 7.4 Servo Calibration → 7.5 Gemini API Key → **7.6 Import All Configs** → 8 System Integration Testing
- **Rationale**: `ninja_core config import` reads from `servo.json`, `buzzer.json`, and `pi0disp/display.json`. These files must exist and be verified before import.
- **Files Modified**: `InstallationGuide.md` (English, Japanese, Chinese sections)

## 2026-02-25: Fix Display Integration — GPIO Pin Mismatch ✓
- **Root Cause**: `ninja_core` `DisplayConfig` defaults were DC=14, RST=15, BLK=16. Actual hardware uses DC=18, RST=19, BLK=20. `pi0disp` standalone worked because it reads its own `display.json` (correct pins). HAL used `config.json` defaults (wrong pins) → backlight and D/C signals went to wrong GPIO → blank display.
- **Fix**:
  - **`config.py`**: Changed `DisplayConfig` defaults to `None` (forces explicit configuration). Added `display.json` import to `import_and_update_config()` (same pattern as servo.json/buzzer.json).
  - **`hal.py`**: `_init_display()` now auto-reads `pi0disp/display.json` as fallback when config pins are None. Logs actual pin values being used.
  - **`InstallationGuide.md`**: Updated wiring table (configurable pins), config import output (shows display.json), troubleshooting (GPIO mismatch).
- **Files Modified**: `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/config.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/hal.py`, `InstallationGuide.md`
- **Validation**: ruff check passed.

## 2026-02-25: Fix Display Integration — Robustness Improvements ✓
- **Root Cause**: Exhaustive code audit confirmed V2 driver's low-level SPI/color code is identical to old driver. Blank display caused by integration-layer issues: (1) V2's delta rendering and window caching introduced silent failure modes absent from old brute-force driver, (2) `facial_expressions.py` silently swallowed ALL exceptions including display errors, (3) HAL never verified display after init, (4) no RGB mode enforcement.
- **Fix**:
  - **`driver.py`**: Switched to full-frame rendering (no delta), removed window caching (RAMWR always sent), added `.convert('RGB')` safety, added logging
  - **`facial_expressions.py`**: Replaced `except (AttributeError, Exception): break` with `log.error()` + stack trace
  - **`hal.py`**: Added `display.clear((0,0,0))` verification after init with detailed logging
  - **`web_server.py`**: Added diagnostic prints around QR/face display fallback paths
- **Files Modified**: `pi0disp/src/pi0disp/core/driver.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/facial_expressions.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/hal.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/web_server.py`, `pi0disp/tests/test_driver.py`
- **Validation**: ruff check passed, 54/54 pytest tests passed.

## 2026-02-25: Fix Display Integration — Rotation Default Mismatch ✓
- **Root Cause**: Old `pi0disp_bak` driver defaulted to `rotation=90` (landscape 320×240), but the new V2 driver defaulted to `rotation=0` (portrait 240×320). Since `hal.py` didn't pass a rotation parameter, the display initialized in wrong orientation — QR codes and face expressions appeared rotated 90°.
- **Fix**: Changed default rotation from 0 to 90 in driver, added `rotation` field to `DisplayConfig`, and passed it from HAL to the ST7789V constructor. User can change rotation via `pi0disp init`.
- **Files Modified**: `pi0disp/src/pi0disp/core/driver.py`, `pi0disp/src/pi0disp/config/config_manager.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/config.py`, `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/hal.py`, `pi0disp/tests/test_driver.py`
- **Validation**: ruff check passed, 54/54 pytest tests passed.

## 2026-02-25: pi0disp V2 — Full Library Rebuild ✓
- **Action**: Built the new pi0disp library from scratch following `pi0disp/RebuildPlan.md`.
- **Details**:
    - **Phase 1 — Scaffold**: Created `pyproject.toml`, `display.json`, package structure with 4 submodules (core/, config/, effects/, cli/).
    - **Phase 2 — Core Driver**: `driver.py` with thread-safe SPI (`threading.Lock()`), smart delta rendering (`PIL.ImageChops.difference()`), PWM brightness, full Actuator ABC, context manager.
    - **Phase 3 — Config Manager**: `config_manager.py` with `init_config()` interactive wizard, display profiles (ST7789V 2.8", Waveshare 2.0"), CRUD operations, export/import.
    - **Phase 4 — Effects**: `text_ticker.py` scrolling text with multilingual font support (EN/JA/ZH-TW).
    - **Phase 5 — CLI**: 7 commands (init, image, text, demo, info, clear, brightness) + `display-tool` interactive menu + `config` subgroup.
    - **Renderer**: `renderer.py` with `ColorConverter` (numpy LUT RGB→RGB565) and `RegionOptimizer` (clamp/merge dirty rects).
    - **Tests**: 54 unit tests (all passing) covering driver, renderer, and config. Thread-safety tests included.
    - **Integration**: Updated `DRIVER_REGISTRY` in `hal.py` from `pi0disp.disp.st7789v` to `pi0disp.core.driver`.
    - **Bug Fixed**: IndexError in `RegionOptimizer.merge_regions()` pop order during aggressive merging.
    - **Lint**: ruff check clean (0 errors).
- **Related Files**: `pi0disp/` (entire new library), `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/hal.py`.

## 2026-02-25: pi0disp V2 — Documentation Update ✓
- **Action**: Updated all project documentation to reflect the pi0disp V2 rebuild.
- **Details**:
    - `pi0disp/README.md`: Full rewrite (370+ lines). Added comprehensive API reference (ST7789V, ConfigManager, TextTicker), all CLI commands with examples, Raspberry Pi testing guide (8 steps), troubleshooting table, architecture diagram.
    - `DevelopmentGuide.md`: Rewrote section 3.4 with V2 module paths, full API tables, `execute()` command keys, ConfigManager/TextTicker docs. Updated file tree, dependency graph, V5.2.4 change summary. Added `pi0disp init` to Required Setup.
    - `InstallationGuide.md`: Updated display test sections in EN/JA/ZH-TW. Replaced `ball_anime` with `demo`. Added `init`, `brightness`, `text`, `info --health-check` test steps. Updated display troubleshooting with `info --health-check` and `init`.
- **Related Files**: `pi0disp/README.md`, `DevelopmentGuide.md`, `InstallationGuide.md`.

## 2026-02-16: Comprehensive Documentation Audit & Refinement ✓
- **Action**: detailed audit of `DevelopmentGuide.md`, `InstallationGuide.md`, and `ProjectUpgradePlan.md` against actual codebase (`pi0servo`, `pi0vl53l0x`).
- **Details**:
    - **DevelopmentGuide.md**: Corrected wrong module names (`multi_servos.py`, `calculator.py`), function signatures (`move_all_sync`, `calculate_duration`), return types, and `ServoCalibration` (7 fields). Added missing method docs.
    - **InstallationGuide.md**: Replaced invalid `uv run pi0servo servo ...` commands with correct `move` or `cmd` syntax across English, Japanese, and Chinese sections.
    - **ProjectUpgradePlan.md**: Updated library inventory to reflect current file structure, refreshed DRIVER_REGISTRY paths, marked pi0servo/pi0vl53l0x phases as Complete, and updated "Last updated" date.
- **Related Files**: `DevelopmentGuide.md`, `InstallationGuide.md`, `ProjectUpgradePlan.md`.


## 2026-02-16: pi0vl53l0x — CLI Refinement & README Restructuring ✓
- **Action**: Restored individual CLI commands alongside `sensor-tool` TUI; restructured README for standalone Pi usage.
- **Details**:
    - Restored individual CLI commands (`get`, `performance`, `calibrate`, `test`, `status`, `config show/export/import`) to `sensor_tool.py` alongside the interactive `sensor-tool` TUI.
    - Added `_create_sensor()` helper for shared sensor initialization across individual commands.
    - Restructured `README.md`: Installation focuses on standalone Raspberry Pi with explicit `uv` setup instructions. CLI sections (interactive + individual commands) moved above Quick Start. All command examples use `uv run` prefix.
    - Fixed stale installation bug: `sensor-tool` command was not found on Pi due to cached old `sensor_tool.py` without the `sensor-tool` subcommand.
- **Related Files**: `pi0vl53l0x/src/pi0vl53l0x/cli/sensor_tool.py`, `pi0vl53l0x/README.md`.


## 2026-02-16: pi0vl53l0x Bug Fix — Entry Point & pigpio Import ✓
- **Action**: Fixed two critical bugs in pi0vl53l0x CLI and documented `uv sync` installation.
- **Details**:
    - Fixed `ImportError: cannot import name 'cli'` — root `pyproject.toml` referenced `:cli` but `__main__.py` only exported `main`. Now exports both.
    - Aligned `pi0vl53l0x/pyproject.toml` entry point to `:cli` (matching root convention).
    - Guarded top-level `VL53L0X` import in `__init__.py` for environments without pigpio.
    - Improved `_connect_pigpio()` error message with `uv sync --extra pi` instructions.
    - Added `uv sync` (recommended) alongside `uv pip install -e .` in `InstallationGuide.md` Step 6.3 (EN/JA/ZH-TW).
    - Updated `pi0vl53l0x/README.md` installation section with `uv sync --extra pi`.
- **Related Files**: `pi0vl53l0x/src/pi0vl53l0x/__main__.py`, `pi0vl53l0x/src/pi0vl53l0x/__init__.py`, `pi0vl53l0x/src/pi0vl53l0x/cli/sensor_tool.py`, `pi0vl53l0x/pyproject.toml`, `InstallationGuide.md`, `pi0vl53l0x/README.md`.

## 2026-02-15: InstallationGuide.md — pi0vl53l0x V2 Content Refinement ✓
- **Action**: Expanded all pi0vl53l0x sections in `InstallationGuide.md` (EN/JA/ZH-TW) to reflect V2 CLI.
- **Details**:
    - Step 7.2 (Test Distance Sensor): Added `test`, `status`, and `calibrate` commands.
    - Test 8.4 (Performance): Added `status` and `config show` commands.
    - Troubleshooting (Distance sensor not responding): Added `test`/`status` diagnostics and power-cycle guidance.
- **Related Files**: `InstallationGuide.md`.

## 2026-02-15: pi0vl53l0x V2 Documentation Update ✓
- **Action**: Updated all project documentation to reflect the pi0vl53l0x V2 rebuild.
- **Details**:
    - `DevelopmentGuide.md`: Rewrote section 3.3 (new I2C/sensor/config/CLI modules, full API reference tables, exception contract, usage examples). Updated file tree, version to 5.2.3, added V5.2.3 change summary, updated dependency graph.
    - `README.md`: Updated version to 5.2.3 and pi0vl53l0x V2 status in EN/JA/ZH-TW.
    - `pi0vl53l0x/README.md`: Full rewrite with directory structure, installation, Python API examples, complete API reference, 8 CLI commands with examples, test coverage table, and ASCII architecture diagram.
- **Related Files**: `DevelopmentGuide.md`, `README.md`, `pi0vl53l0x/README.md`.

## 2026-02-14: pi0vl53l0x V2 Library Rebuild — COMPLETE ✓
- **Action**: Full rewrite of the VL53L0X distance sensor driver from scratch.
- **Details**:
    - **Phase 1 - Scaffold & I2C**: Created `core/i2c.py` with thread-safe `threading.Lock`, exponential backoff retry (10→20→50ms), bus recovery, big-endian word handling. `registers.py` with ~60 semantic constants (22 tests).
    - **Phase 2 - Sensor Driver**: Created `core/sensor.py` with hardened init (firmware boot polling up to 1.0s), fixed V2 offset bug (raw_value now truly raw), defined exception contract (`I2CError`/`TimeoutError`/`RuntimeError`), async support, health check, reinitialize. `driver.py` backward-compat shim (22 tests).
    - **Phase 3 - Config Manager**: Created `config/config_manager.py` with load/save, export/import, corrupt JSON handling, project-relative default path (16 tests).
    - **Phase 4 - CLI Module**: Created `cli/sensor_tool.py` with 8 commands: `get`, `performance`, `calibrate`, `test`, `status`, `config show/export/import`. English output, lazy `pigpio` import.
    - **Phase 5 - Integration**: Verified backward compat with `ninja_core/hal.py` (`pi0vl53l0x.driver.VL53L0X`). Updated `README.md` with full docs.
- **Key Fixes**:
    - **V2 offset bug**: `get_data()` now stores true raw value before offset correction
    - **Reboot bug**: Firmware boot polling with configurable timeout prevents "returns 0"
    - **Thread safety**: All I2C access serialized via `threading.Lock`
- **Validation**: 60/60 tests pass, ruff lint clean.
- **Related Files**: `pi0vl53l0x/src/pi0vl53l0x/*`, `pi0vl53l0x/tests/*`, `pi0vl53l0x/README.md`.

## 2026-02-09: Movement Fluidity Enhancement ✓
- **Issue**: Multi-servo recorded movements feel mechanical with abrupt transitions.
- **Root Cause**: Each step uses `ease_in_out_cubic` independently, creating stop-start pattern.
- **Solution**: Position-aware transition easing:
    - Single step: `ease_in_out_cubic` (full curve)
    - First step: `ease_in_cubic` (accelerate only)
    - Middle steps: `linear` (constant velocity)
    - Last step: `ease_out_cubic` (decelerate to stop)
- **Modified Files**:
    - `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/movement_controller.py`

## 2026-02-09: Ninja Core Servo & Shutdown Fixes ✓
- **Issues Fixed**:
    1. Servo limpness during ninja_core server operation
    2. Missing wake-up behavior (servos not centering on user connect)
    3. Shutdown error traceback on Ctrl+C
- **Root Causes**:
    - `MovementController.move_servos()` didn't pass `force=True` to `move_all_sync()`
    - `trigger_welcome()` only played face/sound, no servo centering
    - `sigint_handler()` raised `KeyboardInterrupt` conflicting with uvloop
- **Fixes**:
    1. Added `force=True` to `move_all_sync()` in movement_controller.py
    2. Added servo centering in `trigger_welcome()` on user connection
    3. Added servo priming at server startup in `lifespan()`
    4. Replaced `raise KeyboardInterrupt` with `sys.exit(0)` for clean shutdown
- **Modified Files**:
    - `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/movement_controller.py`
    - `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/web_server.py`

## 2026-02-09: Servo Limpness Prevention ✓
- **Issue**: Servos occasionally become limp and unresponsive during movements.
- **Root Cause**: `move_all_sync()` skips PWM updates when `distance < 0.1°`, combined with stale `last_angle` tracking.
- **Solutions Implemented**:
    1. Added `refresh()` and `ensure_active()` methods to `Servo` class
    2. Added `force` flag to `move_all_sync()` to bypass skip-if-negligible logic
    3. Added skip logging for debugging (`logger.debug()`)
    4. Added `refresh_all()` and `ensure_all_active()` to `ServoGroup`
    5. Updated `servo_tool.py` to reuse persistent `ServoGroup`, preserving `last_angle` state
- **Modified Files**:
    - `pi0servo/src/pi0servo/core/servo.py`
    - `pi0servo/src/pi0servo/core/multi_servos.py`
    - `pi0servo/src/pi0servo/cli/servo_tool.py`
- **Tests**: All 82 unit tests passed
## 2026-02-09: Fix First-Run Servo Initialization ✓
- **Issue**: After Pi restart, servos didn't react on first CLI run; auto-center failed.
- **Root Cause**: `move_all_sync()` skips movement when `distance < 0.1`. On first run, `last_angle=None` and `get_pulse()=0`, so code falls back to `angle_center=0`. Since target is also 0, movement was skipped.
- **Fix**: Use `center_all()` (direct PWM) instead of `move_all_sync()` for startup centering.
- **Modified Files**:
    - `pi0servo/src/pi0servo/cli/servo_tool.py` - Replaced `move_all_sync()` with `center_all()`
    - `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/movement_cli.py` - Use direct `hal.servos.center_all()`

## 2026-02-09: Auto-Center Servos on CLI Start/Quit ✓
- **Action**: Added automatic servo centering (0°) when starting and quitting CLI tools.
- **Changes**:
    - On tool startup: all calibrated servos move to 0°
    - On tool exit: all servos center before shutdown
- **Modified Files**:
    - `pi0servo/src/pi0servo/cli/servo_tool.py`
    - `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/movement_cli.py`

## 2026-02-09: Servo Smoothness Optimization ✓
- **Action**: Reduced jittering by increasing update frequency and adding cubic easing.
- **Changes**:
    - Step interval: 20ms → 10ms (50Hz → 100Hz)
    - Added 3 cubic easing functions: `ease_in_cubic`, `ease_out_cubic`, `ease_in_out_cubic`
    - Default easing: `ease_in_out` → `ease_in_out_cubic`
- **Modified Files**:
    - `pi0servo/src/pi0servo/motion/easing.py`
    - `pi0servo/src/pi0servo/motion/__init__.py`
    - `pi0servo/src/pi0servo/core/multi_servos.py`
    - `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/movement_controller.py`

## 2026-02-09: Default Easing Changed to ease_in_out ✓
- **Action**: Changed default servo easing from `ease_out` to `ease_in_out`.
- **Reason**: Provides smoother motion at both start and end of movements.
- **Modified Files**:
    - `pi0servo/src/pi0servo/core/multi_servos.py` - All method defaults
    - `ninja_core/src/ninja_core/movement_controller.py` - `move_servos()` call

## 2026-02-08: Phase 12 - Documentation Update ✓
- **Action**: Updated all documentation for pi0servo V2 integration.
- **Changes**:
    - Deleted `pi0servo_bak` folder.
    - Updated `README.md` version to 5.2.1 in all language sections.
    - Updated `DevelopmentGuide.md` file structure (pi0servo now has cli, config, core, motion, parser folders).
    - Replaced Section 3.5 pi0servo API docs with new ServoGroup/ConfigManager/MotionPlanner API.
    - Updated `ninja_core/README.md` driver registry (ServoGroup instead of MultiServo).
- **Note**: `pi0servo/tests/` folder contains valid unit tests and was kept.

## 2026-02-08: Phase 11 - First Run Servo Issue ✓
- **Issue**: Servo 23 had no reaction on first movement-tool run after calibrating pin 23.
- **Root Cause**: After calibration, `config` was reloaded but HAL's `ServoGroup` kept old pin list. New pins (e.g., 23) not included until restart.
- **Solution**: After calibration, turn off old servos and reinitialize HAL with new config:
    - `hal.servos.off()` - release old PWM
    - `hal.config = config` - update config reference
    - `hal._init_servos()` - create new ServoGroup with all pins
- **Related Files**: `movement_cli.py`, `hal.py`.

## 2026-02-08: Phase 10 - Movement Tool Health Check ✓
- **Issue**: `edit_sequence_menu` threw `TypeError: dict - int` when editing/inserting steps.
- **Root Cause**: `parse_movement_command` returns `{pin: {"angle": X, "speed": Y}}`, but edit/insert stored this directly as `moves` instead of extracting angles.
- **Solution**:
    - Added `extract_movement_data()` helper to split parsed moves into `(angles_dict, per_servo_speeds_dict)`.
    - Fixed Edit Step, Insert Step to use helper and store separate `moves` and `per_servo_speeds`.
    - Fixed Preview to pass `per_servo_speeds` to `move_servos`.
- **Related Files**: `movement_cli.py`.

## 2026-02-08: Phase 9 - Fix Silent Failure ✓
- **Issue**: movement-tool showed no reaction when entering servo commands.
- **Root Cause**: `ServoArrayWrapper` was missing methods that `MovementController` calls:
    - `move_all_sync()` - per-servo speed movement
    - `pins` property - ordered GPIO pin list
    - `get_all_angles()` - current angle state
    - `move_all_angles()` - instant movement
- **Solution**: Added wrapper methods to `ServoArrayWrapper` that proxy to `_multi_servo`.
- **Related Files**: `api_wrappers.py`.

## 2026-02-08: Phase 8 - Per-Servo Speed Execution ✓
- **Action**: Refactored `MovementController` to use pi0servo's velocity-based motion.
- **Root Cause**: Old implementation used manual interpolation with single global duration.
- **Solution**:
    - `move_servos()` now calls `move_all_sync(speed_mode=list[str])` for per-servo speeds.
    - Each servo calculates its own duration: `distance / (speed_limit × mode_factor)`.
    - Faster servos reach target before slower ones within the same movement.
- **Flow**: Parser → Recording → Storage (`per_servo_speeds`) → Execution
- **Related Files**: `movement_controller.py`, `movement_cli.py`.

## 2026-02-08: Phase 7 Refinements - Speed & Parser ✓
- **Action**: Added speed field import and per-servo speed parsing.
- **Issue 1 - Speed not imported**:
    - `ServoCalibration` model now includes `speed: int = 80` field.
    - `import_and_update_config()` now maps `speed` from servo.json.
- **Issue 2 - Per-servo speed parsing**:
    - `parse_movement_command()` now parses suffixes: `22:45S`, `23:-30F`.
    - Returns `{pin: {"angle": value, "speed": str|None}}` format.
    - `record_new_movement()` stores `per_servo_speeds` in sequence.
- **Command Format** (matches pi0servo servo-tool):
    - Global: `F_22:45/23:-30` → All servos use Fast speed
    - Per-servo: `22:45S/23:-30F` → Pin 22 Slow, Pin 23 Fast
    - Mixed: `F_22:45/23:-30S` → Global Fast, but Pin 23 overrides to Slow
- **Related Files**: `ninja_core/config.py`, `ninja_core/movement_cli.py`.

## 2026-02-08: Fixed pi0servo Integration Issues ✓
- **Action**: Fixed config import compatibility between pi0servo and ninja_core.
- **Root Cause**: 
    - pi0servo saves `servo.json` as dict with `pulse_min/center/max` field names.
    - ninja_core `import_and_update_config()` only handled list format and used `min_pulse/center_pulse/max_pulse`.
- **Solution**: 
    - Updated `config.py` to handle both dict (pi0servo) and list (legacy) formats.
    - Added field name mapping: `pulse_min` → `min_pulse`, `pulse_center` → `center_pulse`, etc.
- **Commands Verified**:
    - `uv run ninja_core config import` ✓ (alias for import-all)
    - `uv run ninja_core config import-all` ✓
    - `uv run ninja_core movement-tool` ✓ (not `ninja-cli movement`)
- **Related Files**: `ninja_core/config.py`.

## 2026-02-08: pi0servo Integration Phase 3 & 4 ✓
- **Action**: Completed angle standardization and velocity-based movement.
- **Phase 3 - Angle Standardization (±90°)**:
    - Updated `api_wrappers.py`: ServoWrapper and ServoArrayWrapper now use ±90° directly.
    - Removed all 0-180 → ±90 conversions (breaking change for Blockly programs).
    - Center position now 0° (was 90° in old API).
- **Phase 4 - Movement-Tool Enhancement**:
    - Updated `movement_controller.py`: Replaced fixed `duration_map` with `calculate_duration()`.
    - Uses physics-based velocity calculation (SG90 spec: 600°/sec).
    - Duration now depends on actual travel distance and speed mode (F/M/S).
- **Verification**: Ruff lint passed for both files.
- **Related Files**: `ninja_core/api_wrappers.py`, `ninja_core/movement_controller.py`.

## 2026-02-08: pi0servo Integration into ninja_core - Phase 1 ✓
- **Action**: Integrated rebuilt `pi0servo` library into `ninja_core` HAL.
- **Breaking Changes**:
    - **DRIVER_REGISTRY**: Updated to point to `pi0servo.core.multi_servos.ServoGroup` (was `multi_servo.MultiServo`).
    - **HAL init**: Modified `_init_servos()` to use `ConfigManager` for pre-loading calibrations.
    - Calibrations now passed as `dict[int, ServoCalibration]` instead of `conf_file` path.
- **Legacy Compatibility**:
    - Added `move_all_angles()` method to `ServoGroup` for instant movement.
    - Added `get_all_angles()` method to `ServoGroup` for reading current state.
    - Added `servo` property to `ServoGroup` for list-style access.
    - Existing `move_all_angles_sync()` wrapper maintained for duration-based calls.
- **Verification**: Ruff lint passed for both `hal.py` and `multi_servos.py`.
- **Related Files**: `ninja_core/hal.py`, `pi0servo/core/multi_servos.py`.


## 2026-02-08: Fixed GPIO Initialization Error ✓
- **Action**: Fixed critical error `'GPIO is not in use for servo pulses'` that occurred after reboot.
- **Root Cause**: `get_servo_pulsewidth()` throws exception when GPIO has no PWM initialized (after reboot).
- **Solution**:
    - Wrapped `get_pulse()` in try/except to return 0 on pigpio error.
    - Changed default calibration to safe values (all pulses = 1500) to prevent unexpected servo movement.
    - Added `HARDWARE_PULSE_MIN/MAX` constants (500/2500) to `calib.py` for calibration TUI (separate from default calibration).
- **Documentation**:
    - Added calibration CAUTION warning to README Quick Start.
    - Clarified `uv sync` installation (no manual venv activation needed).
    - Added NOTE about default uncalibrated behavior in Configuration section.
- **Tests**: Added 2 new tests for exception handling, updated 6 tests for new defaults. **82/82 passed**.
- **Related Files**: `core/servo.py`, `cli/calib.py`, `README.md`, `tests/test_core.py`, `tests/test_config.py`.

## 2026-02-08: Per-Servo Speed Control Implemented ✓
- **Action**: Added support for individual servo speed overrides in `movement-tool` commands.
- **Details**:
    - **Parser**: Updated `parse_command` to detect speed suffixes (e.g., `45F`, `45S`).
    - **Logic**: Updated `move_all_sync/async` to apply per-servo duration scaling.
    - **Validation**: Enforced strict regex matching to prevent invalid command parsing.
- **Documentation**: Updated `README.md` with new command syntax and examples.
- **Verification**: Added unit tests for new parser features (27/27 passed).
- **Related Files**: `parser/command.py`, `core/multi_servos.py`, `README.md`.

## 2026-02-08: Servo-Tool Movement Control Fixes ✓
- **Action**: Fixed 3 user-reported issues from servo-tool testing.
- **Issue 1: Calibration Not Refreshing**:
    - Added `manager.load()` after `CalibApp.main()` returns in `servo_tool.py`.
    - New calibration values now apply immediately without restarting servo-tool.
- **Issue 2: Speed Control Not Working**:
    - Refactored `move_all_sync()` and `move_all_async()` to use **per-servo timing**.
    - Each servo now moves at its own calibrated speed (faster servos finish first).
    - Changed from step-based to time-based movement loop (`time.monotonic()`).
- **Issue 3: Continuous Input Mode**:
    - Rewrote `quick_move()` and `single_move()` with continuous input loops.
    - Users can enter multiple commands until pressing 'q' to return to menu.
- **Verification**: 74/74 tests passing, linter clean.
- **Related Files**: `servo_tool.py`, `multi_servos.py`.

    - Added detailed calibration guide with speed control, easing explanation, and command reference.
    - Added Python API section for setting speed limits programmatically.
- **Verification**: `uv run ruff check` passed for all source files.
- **Related Files**: `config_manager.py`, `config_cmd.py`, `servo_tool.py`, `calib.py`, `servo.py`, `README.md`.

## 2026-02-08: pi0servo V5 Refinement - Bugs Fixed ✓
- **Action**: Fixed 4 user-reported bugs + 4 audit gaps to complete the pi0servo library to 100%.
- **P0 Bug Fixes**:

    - All servo movements complete before system shutdown proceeds.
- **Verification**: `ruff check` passed.
- **Related Files**: `web_server.py`, `config.json` (Poweroff movement definition).

## 2026-01-09: Blockly Execution Flow & Agent Merger
- **Action**: Modified code execution to bypass `NinjaCoderAgent` and merged its capabilities into `NinjaAgent`.
- **Details**:
    - **Direct Execution**: `dispatcher.py` now executes code immediately via `SafeExecutor`.
    - **Parallel Explanation**: `dispatcher.py` triggers async `NinjaAgent.explain_code()` for instant feedback.
    - **Agent Merger**: Migrated `generate_code`, `analyze_error`, `analyze_code` to `NinjaAgent` using dynamic `temperature=0.1`.
    - **Cleanup**: Deleted `ninja_coder.py` and removed references in `web_server.py`.

- **Action**: Updated `InstallationGuide.md` to include Node.js and ninja_webapp build instructions.
- **Details**:
    - Added **Step 4.6: Install Node.js** using NodeSource LTS.
    - Added **Step 6.4: Build the Web Interface** (`npm install && npm run build`).
    - Renumbered subsequent steps in all three language versions.
- **Affected Sections**: English, Japanese (日本語), Traditional Chinese (繁體中文).
- **Related Files**: `InstallationGuide.md`.

## 2026-01-08: Server Shutdown Hang Fix (V3)
- **Action**: Fixed server hanging on Ctrl+C during shutdown.
- **Details**:
    - **V1 (failed)**: Targeted `asyncio.gather()` with timeout—problem persisted.
    - **V2 (failed)**: Added `shutdown_event` for WebSocket handlers—lifespan shutdown ran TOO LATE (after connections closed).
    - **V3 (solution)**: Registered a custom SIGINT signal handler that runs BEFORE Uvicorn's. On Ctrl+C:
        1. `shutdown_event.set()` → WebSocket handlers exit loops
        2. `faces.stop()` → Animation thread stops
        3. `distance_monitor.stop_continuous()` → Sensor thread stops
        4. `hal.shutdown()` → Display turns off
        5. `ngrok.kill()` → Tunnel closes
        6. Uvicorn proceeds with normal shutdown
- **Verification**: `ruff check` passed.
- **Related Files**: `web_server.py`.

## 2026-01-07: Phase 5.2 - Educational 2-Agent Workflow & API Optimization - COMPLETE

        - **Agent**: Full-width chat dialog, hardware controls (expressions/sounds/movements), distance sensor display, slidable bottom log panel.
        - **Help**: Documentation and troubleshooting.
    - **Components**: Layout (Header, Footer), Button, IconButton, LanguageSelector, PowerOffSlider.
    - **Features**:
        - Multi-language support (EN, JA, ZH-TW, ZH-CN).
        - BLE advertising status indicator in header.
        - Voice input via Web Speech API with language auto-detection.

- **Related Files**: `ninja_webapp/src/*`, `ninja_core/web_server.py`

## 2026-01-03: Phase 4 Backend Core & Agent Intelligence - COMPLETE
- **Action**: Implemented Safe Execution Engine and NinjaCoder Agent.
- **Details**:
    - Created `ninja_core/safe_executor.py`: Threaded logic for safe code execution (restricted globals).
    - Created `ninja_core/ninja_coder.py`: AI Agent specialized for Python coding (Gemini 3 Flash).
    - Updated `ninja_core/dispatcher.py`: Integrated `SafeExecutor` with real-time log broadcasting.
    - Updated `ninja_core/web_server.py`: Added API endpoints (`/api/code/execute`, `/api/code/analyze`).
- **Verification**: `test_safe_executor.py` passed. Linting verified.
- **Cleanup**: Removed legacy `app` folder (web client moved to Phase 5).
- **Related Files**: `safe_executor.py`, `ninja_coder.py`, `dispatcher.py`, `web_server.py`

## 2026-01-04: Phase 4 Refinement - Code Execution & Error Feedback

- **Details**:
    - **Safe Imports**: Patched `SafeExecutor` to allow `time`, `math`, `random` via custom `__import__`.
    - **API Wrappers**: Implemented `RobotWrapper` in `api_wrappers.py` to bridge the gap between low-level HAL and Blockly/IDE high-level API.
    - **AI Code Translation**: Implemented `translate_code` in `NinjaCoderAgent` and hooked it into `CommandDispatcher`. Incoming code is now automatically optimized/fixed by the AI Agent before execution (e.g., mapping "startup" sound to tones).
    - **Ninja Core Compatibility**: Mocked `from ninja_core import robot` to return the Wrapped Robot instance.
    - **Error Feedback**: Implemented `on_complete` callback in `SafeExecutor`.
    - **Agent Integration**: `Dispatcher` now broadcasts "Optimizing..." status and error diagnosis.
- **Verification**: `test_safe_executor.py` updated and passed.
- **Related Files**: `safe_executor.py`, `dispatcher.py`, `ninja_coder.py`, `test_safe_executor.py`, `api_wrappers.py`
- **WebSocket Fix (2026-01-04)**: Added `ConnectionManager` and `/ws/events` endpoint to bridge `Dispatcher` broadcasts to the Web UI. Fixed critical JavaScript syntax error in `main.js` (`pass;` was Python, not JS) that prevented the event WebSocket from connecting.

## 2026-10-07 — NinjaRobotPi0 repository migration

- Renamed the local repository folder from NinjaRobotV5 to NinjaRobotPi0 and configured the official NinjaRoboticsEducation/NinjaRobotPi0 origin.
- Prepared a fresh root commit on main; legacy history and branches remain only in a private local rollback backup. No release tag was requested.
- Updated current project documentation, clone instructions, and workflow names. Historical log entries retain their original names.
- Python packages, package metadata, lockfiles, runtime files, and robot behavior are unchanged.
- Validation: tracked-snapshot credential-pattern scan found no matches; robot code and package files are compared by Git blob identity before publication. No Raspberry Pi or hardware checks are performed for this migration.


## 2026-10-07 — Repository migration audit corrections

- Corrected current product names in multilingual manuals and package README files while retaining Python package identities and historical V5 version milestones.
- Completed project naming in Cursor and agent descriptors.
- Added a clean-clone wiki bootstrap that regenerates ignored source manifests before lint, using existing llmwiki commands. The prior zero-error result covered the prepared local checkout.
- Verified the fresh Git history and preserved robot runtime/package files against the private legacy snapshot. No robot runtime or hardware behavior was changed or exercised.
- The separate workspace audit report records clean-clone, website, source-mirror, and wiki validation results.
