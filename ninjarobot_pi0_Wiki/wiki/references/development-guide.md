  notes:
  - Checked the current full manual and Trixie correction evidence against the narrow
    release-gate diff and interpreter tests. Prior unrelated claims retain their cited
    sources. Both Bookworm and Trixie are allowed on Zero 2 W/aarch64; physical Trixie
    acceptance and publication of this fix are pending.
  - Source-grounded AI review of changed claims and retained cited context; draft/unverified.
    Physical tests, live accounts and publication remain pending.

# Current development manual

Resolve the complete current DevelopmentGuide through project-knowledge.json or the wiki README. It documents protected core/driver functions, additive onboarding, UI contract preservation, immutable source versions and host/wiki validation. Root DevelopmentGuide.md is a compatibility pointer; earlier detailed API/history material is preserved as historical context.[^src-20261008-developmentguide]

[Project overview](/overview.md).

[^src-20261008-developmentguide]: Current versioned Developmentguide.

## Implementation evidence and acceptance limits

Host validation and the exact code/tooling boundary are recorded in the approved implementation evidence. Real Pi hardware, live accounts and published curl acceptance remain pending; passing host checks do not imply physical acceptance.[^src-20261007-2026-10-07-install-onboard-wiki-ui-2]

## 2026-10-08 audit follow-up

The current manual reflects the audit regressions and README publication role. Explicit wiki setup clears UV_PROJECT and can discover installer-owned private uv; read-only commands still never install dependencies. Core/driver behavior is protected and physical acceptance remains separate.[^src-20261007-2026-10-08-upgrade-audit]

## Trixie support correction

The current complete development manual adds the Bookworm/Trixie target matrix and Python 3.11/3.13 CI. Keep shell and Python release rejection tests consistent. Locked host tests do not certify Debian arm64 installation or physical operation.[^src-20261008-2026-10-08-trixie-support]
