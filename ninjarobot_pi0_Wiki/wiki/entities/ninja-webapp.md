# ninja_webapp Package

## Current visual design

Current frontend metadata declares React 19.2.0; older React 18 descriptions are historical. The Pi5-derived navy/cyan tokens, panels, menu sheet and activity drawer apply to Pi0 Home, Agent and Help. Routes, request payloads, WebSocket events, millimetre units and existing action selectors remain Pi0-specific. BLE advertising is not controller connection. Four locale sets include previously missing labels; power still requires staged user action plus confirmation, with an accessible keyboard alternative.[^src-20261007-developmentguide-2]


`ninja_webapp` is the modern web frontend for NinjaRobotPi0, previously described as React 18, Vite, and `react-router-dom`.[^src-20260822-readme] [^src-20260822-developmentguide]

## Architecture & Technology

* **Earlier framework description**: React 18 + Vite.[^src-20260822-developmentguide]
* **Styling**: Vanilla CSS with curated responsive tokens and modern micro-animations.[^src-20260822-developmentguide]
* **Internationalization**: `react-i18next` translations for English (`en`), Japanese (`ja`), Traditional Chinese (`zh-tw`), and Simplified Chinese (`zh-cn`).[^src-20260822-readme] [^src-20260822-developmentguide]
* **Real-Time Communication**: `/ws/distance` supplies `distance_mm`; `/ws/events` supplies activity/log events. The old combined-distance description was documentation drift.[^src-20261007-2026-10-07-install-onboard-wiki-ui-2]

## Application Pages

* **Home (`/`)**: Hero branding display and interactive slide-to-confirm power-off slider for safe robot shutdown.[^src-20260822-developmentguide]
* **Agent (`/agent`)**: Main control dashboard featuring:
  * **AI Chat Dialog**: Conversational text and voice input with Google Gemini.[^src-20260822-readme] [^src-20260822-developmentguide]
  * **Hardware Quick Controls**: Direct triggering of facial expressions, sounds, and recorded movements.[^src-20260822-developmentguide]
  * **Real-Time Telemetry**: Distance sensor reading display with safety indicators.[^src-20260822-readme] [^src-20260822-developmentguide]
  * **Slidable System Log Panel**: Real-time log monitor for debugging and telemetry.[^src-20260822-developmentguide]
* **Help (`/help`)**: User manual and quick reference documentation.[^src-20260822-developmentguide]

## Repository migration (2026-10-07)

The former NinjaRobotV5 repository is now NinjaRobotPi0 at [NinjaRoboticsEducation/NinjaRobotPi0](https://github.com/NinjaRoboticsEducation/NinjaRobotPi0). The local folder is `NinjaRobotPi0/`. The new repository starts with fresh history on `main`; Python packages and robot runtime behavior are retained. Manual links use `blob/HEAD` to follow the GitHub default branch. Historical names and audit findings remain provenance; this migration does not resolve them.[^src-20261007-2026-10-07-ninjarobot-pi0-repository-migration]

[^src-20261007-2026-10-07-ninjarobot-pi0-repository-migration]: Registered evidence for the approved 2026-10-07 repository migration.

[^src-20261007-developmentguide-2]: Current versioned Developmentguide.

## Implementation evidence and acceptance limits

Host validation and the exact code/tooling boundary are recorded in the approved implementation evidence. Real Pi hardware, live accounts and published curl acceptance remain pending; passing host checks do not imply physical acceptance.[^src-20261007-2026-10-07-install-onboard-wiki-ui-2]
