# Development History and Evolution

The NinjaRobot project evolved from a monolithic educational robot into the modular, AI-powered NinjaRobot V5 platform.[^src-20260822-developmentguide] This document records the chronological milestones, architectural phases, and reliability audits throughout development.[^src-20260822-developmentlog] [^src-20260822-developmentguide]

## Major Development Phases

* **Phase 1 (Modularity & ABCs)**: Decoupled hardware into independent packages (`pi0servo`, `pi0buzzer`, `pi0disp`, `pi0vl53l0x`, `ninja_utils`) and introduced `Sensor` and `Actuator` ABCs with dynamic HAL loading.[^src-20260822-developmentguide]
* **Phase 2 (Dual Connectivity)**: Implemented `ninja_ble` BLE GATT server and central `CommandDispatcher` in `ninja_core`.[^src-20260822-developmentguide]
* **Phase 3 (Binary Chunking)**: Designed binary packet fragmentation and CRC32 verification for transferring large payloads over BLE.[^src-20260822-developmentguide]
* **Phase 4 (Agent Intelligence & Sandboxing)**: Integrated Google Gemini AI agent and built `SafeExecutor` sandboxed Python runtime.[^src-20260822-developmentguide]
* **Phase 5 (Modern Web Application)**: Developed the React 18 + Vite SPA frontend (`ninja_webapp`) with WebSockets telemetry and multilingual support.[^src-20260822-developmentguide]

## V5.2.x Refinements & Classroom Reliability Chronology

* **V5.2.0 (Graceful Shutdown)**: Added `_perform_shutdown_animation()` executing parallel sleepy face/sound, rest posture, and safe power-off sequence.[^src-20260822-developmentguide]
* **V5.2.1 (pi0servo Integration)**: Rebuilt servo control with velocity-based motion, abort mechanism, and calibration managers.[^src-20260822-developmentguide]
* **V5.2.2 (Movement Fluidity)**: Introduced position-aware multi-step cubic easing (`ease_in_cubic` → `linear` → `ease_out_cubic`).[^src-20260822-developmentguide]
* **V5.2.3 (pi0vl53l0x V2)**: Hardened sensor init, thread-safe I2C, transaction-level locking, and interactive CLI.[^src-20260822-developmentguide]
* **V5.2.4 (pi0disp V2)**: Thread-safe SPI locking, delta rendering with numpy LUT, and `TextTicker`.[^src-20260822-developmentguide]
* **V5.2.5 (Blockly Runtime Reliability)**: AST preflight syntax checking, correlation of events by `request_id`, and distance fallback to `9999`.[^src-20260822-developmentguide] [^src-20260822-developmentlog]
* **V5.2.6 (Dual Pipeline)**: Created `RuntimePipeline` to eliminate expression/display ownership conflicts between native idle and Blockly code.[^src-20260822-developmentguide] [^src-20260822-developmentlog]
* **V5.2.7 (GPIO Motion Contract)**: Added `robot.servos.move_pin()` and `move_pins()` for Blockly code generation.[^src-20260822-developmentguide] [^src-20260822-developmentlog]
* **V5.2.8 (Blockly Text & Music)**: Added multilingual `robot.display.text()` and built-in melody playback in `pi0buzzer`.[^src-20260822-developmentguide] [^src-20260822-developmentlog]
* **V5.2.9 (BLE Robot Naming)**: Added persistent `bluetooth.name` configuration and custom BlueZ advertisement naming.[^src-20260822-developmentguide] [^src-20260822-developmentlog]
* **V5.2.10 (Saved Action Library)**: Implemented `ActionLibrary` for on-robot storage of Code IDE Blockly programs with AI agent replay.[^src-20260822-developmentguide] [^src-20260822-developmentlog]
* **V5.2.11 (Guided Setup & Profile Sync)**: Added `init-tool` CLI and synchronized `robot_info` (robot type, servo pin mappings) over BLE with Code IDE.[^src-20260822-developmentguide] [^src-20260822-developmentlog]
* **V5.2.12 (Gemini Model Selection)**: Replaced the fixed agent model setup with API-key-specific catalog discovery, interactive selection, and backward-compatible `gemini.model` configuration.[^src-20260822-developmentguide] [^src-20260822-developmentlog]
* **V5.2.13 (Gemini 3 Runtime Compatibility)**: Added selection-time generation validation, low-thinking REST generation for Gemini 3, bounded runtime requests, and model-specific diagnostics.[^src-20260822-developmentguide] [^src-20260822-developmentlog]
* **2026-05-17 (Code IDE Assistant Compatibility)**: Audited and synchronized documentation ensuring AI assistant provider keys and comments maintain client-server boundary security.[^src-20260822-developmentlog]

## Repository migration (2026-10-07)

The former NinjaRobotV5 repository is now NinjaRobotPi0 at [NinjaRoboticsEducation/NinjaRobotPi0](https://github.com/NinjaRoboticsEducation/NinjaRobotPi0). The local folder is `NinjaRobotPi0/`. The new repository starts with fresh history on `main`; Python packages and robot runtime behavior are retained. Manual links use `blob/HEAD` to follow the GitHub default branch. Historical names and audit findings remain provenance; this migration does not resolve them.[^src-20261007-2026-10-07-ninjarobot-pi0-repository-migration]
