# Ninja Core

This package contains the main application logic for NinjaRobot V5. It integrates all the individual hardware libraries (`pi0servo`, `pi0buzzer`, etc.) into a cohesive system managed by a central configuration and a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL).

## Key Components

- **`hal.py` (Hardware Abstraction Layer):** Initializes and provides a single access point for all hardware drivers.
- **`config.py` (Configuration Manager):** Manages all robot settings from a central `config.json` file.
- **`dispatcher.py` (Command Dispatcher):** Central router for BLE and Web commands. Bridges all input sources.
- **`safe_executor.py` (Safe Execution - Phase 4):** Sandboxed environment for running user/AI-generated Python code safely. Blocks dangerous imports.
- **`ninja_coder.py` (AI Code Agent - Phase 4):** Gemini-powered agent for code generation, translation, and debugging.
- **`api_wrappers.py` (Robot API - Phase 4):** High-level wrappers (`RobotWrapper`, `BuzzerWrapper`, `DisplayWrapper`, `DistanceWrapper`) exposed as `robot` in the executor.
- **`movement_controller.py` (Motion System):** Executes complex, multi-servo movement sequences.
- **`facial_expressions.py`, `robot_sound.py`, `perception.py`:** High-level controllers for expressions, sounds, and sensing.
- **`web_server.py` (FastAPI Server):** Web interface with WebSocket support for real-time events (Phase 4: `/ws/events` added).

## V5 Changes

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of V5, the HAL uses **dynamic driver loading** via `importlib` and validates drivers against ABCs.

### Key Changes:
- **Dynamic Loading**: Drivers are loaded from a registry, not hardcoded imports.
- **ABC Validation**: All drivers implement `Sensor` or `Actuator` interfaces.
- **Config Import**: Run `uv run ninja_core config import` to merge `servo.json` and `buzzer.json` into `config.json`.

### Driver Registry:
```python
DRIVER_REGISTRY = {
    "servos": {"module": "pi0servo.core.servo_group", "class": "ServoGroup"},  # V5.2.1
    "buzzer": {"module": "pi0buzzer.driver", "class": "MusicBuzzer"},
    "display": {"module": "pi0disp.disp.st7789v", "class": "ST7789V"},
    "distance_sensor": {"module": "pi0vl53l0x.driver", "class": "VL53L0X"},
}
```

## The Motion System (`movement_controller.py`)

The Motion System is responsible for all servo-based movements. It is composed of two main parts: the runtime `MovementController` class and the interactive `movement-tool` CLI.

### `MovementController` Class

This class is the runtime engine for executing pre-defined motion sequences.
- It is initialized with the HAL and `NinjaConfig` objects, removing the need for direct hardware or file system access.
- Its primary method, `execute_movement(movement_name)`, plays back a named sequence from the configuration.
- It uses **position-aware easing** for fluid multi-step motions:
  - **First step:** `ease_in_cubic` (accelerate only)
  - **Middle steps:** `linear` (constant velocity through waypoints)
  - **Last step:** `ease_out_cubic` (decelerate to stop)
- This eliminates the stop-start pattern between steps, creating smooth momentum-preserving motion.

### `movement-tool` CLI

This is an interactive, command-line tool for developers to **calibrate, create, edit, and test** all servo-related functions. You can launch it by running `uv run ninja_core movement-tool` from the project root.

The tool presents a main menu with the following options:

- **1. Calibrate a Servo:** Launches the `pi0servo` calibration tool for a selected servo. This allows you to define the min, center, and max pulse widths. The new calibration is automatically imported into the application's main configuration when the tool is running.
- **2. Record new movement:** Starts the interactive recorder to create a new, named motion sequence step-by-step.
- **3. Modify existing movement:** Provides a menu to interactively edit, insert, or delete steps within a saved movement.
- **4. Execute a movement:** Plays back a saved movement, with options for looping.
- **5. Clear movement:** Deletes a saved movement from the configuration.
- **6. Exit:** Closes the tool and safely shuts down the hardware, saving all changes to `config.json`.

#### In-Depth Guide: Recording a New Movement

This feature allows you to define a sequence of positions for your servos, which are then saved as a single, named movement (e.g., "wave", "nod").

##### Command Input Rules

When recording, you define each step using a special command syntax:

| Rule                | Description                                                                                                                            | Example                |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Basic Format**    | A GPIO pin number and an angle, separated by a colon. Angles range from -90 to 90.                                                     | `17:45`                |
| **Angle Keywords**  | Use keywords for common angles: `C` for Center (0°), `M` for Minimum (-90°), and `X` for Maximum (90°).                                  | `17:C`                 |
| **Chaining**        | Multiple servo movements in the same step are chained together with a `/`.                                                              | `17:45/22:-30`         |
| **Speed Prefix**    | Set the speed for a step with a prefix: `S_` (Slow), `M_` (Medium), or `F_` (Fast). Medium is the default.                               | `S_17:90/22:90`        |
| **Auto-Completion** | **(Crucial Rule)** If a servo isn't specified in a command, it automatically holds its position from the *previous* step. This is the key to creating smooth, continuous motions. | If step 1 is `17:45` and step 2 is `22:30`, servo 17 remains at 45° during step 2. |

## Testing the Core Components

This guide assumes you are in the root directory of the `NinjaRobotV4` project and have already installed all dependencies.

### Prerequisites

1.  **pigpio Daemon:** Before running any test, ensure the `pigpio` service is running.
    ```bash
    sudo pigpiod
    ```
2.  **Initial Configuration:** If you have not yet created the master `config.json`, run the import command at least once.
    ```bash
    uv run ninja_core config import-all
    ```

### Step 1: Calibrate and Test the Motion System

This workflow demonstrates the seamless integration of the calibration and movement tools.

1.  **Launch the Movement Tool:**
    ```bash
    uv run ninja_core movement-tool
    ```

2.  **Calibrate a Servo:**
    - Select option **1** to "Calibrate a Servo."
    - Choose the servo pin you wish to calibrate from the list.
    - The `pi0servo` calibration interface will launch. Follow the on-screen instructions (`h` for help) to set the Min, Center, and Max positions.
    - Press `q` to quit the calibration tool.
    - The `movement-tool` will automatically import the new settings and re-initialize the hardware.

3.  **Record a Movement:**
    - Select option **2** to "Record new movement."
    - Create a simple movement (e.g., `17:45`, confirm, then `17:C`, finish) and name it `test_wave`.

4.  **Execute the Movement:**
    - Select option **4** to "Execute a movement."
    - Choose the `test_wave` movement and loop it once.
    - **Expected Result:** The servo will smoothly move to its 45-degree position and back, respecting the calibration you just set.

5.  **Exit:** Select option **6** to exit. All your new calibration and movement data will be saved to `config.json`.

### Step 2: Test Other Core Components

You can test other hardware functionalities using the pre-made test scripts in the project root:

- **Test HAL (Servos and Buzzer):**
  ```bash
  uv run python test_hal.py
  ```
- **Test Display System:**
  ```bash
  uv run python test_facial_expressions.py
  ```
- **Test Sound System:**
  ```bash
  uv run python test_robot_sound.py
  ```
- **Test Perception System:**
  ```bash
-   **Test HAL (Servos and Buzzer):**
    ```bash
    uv run python test_hal.py
    ```
-   **Test Display System:**
    ```bash
    uv run python test_facial_expressions.py
    ```
-   **Test Sound System:**
    ```bash
    uv run python test_robot_sound.py
    ```
-   **Test Perception System:**
    ```bash
    uv run python test_perception.py
    ```

This confirms that all `ninja_core` systems are successfully communicating with and controlling the hardware.

### Step 3: Test the AI Agent

The AI Agent allows you to control the robot using natural language.

#### 3.1. Setup Google Gemini API Key and Model

1.  **Create an API Key:**
    -   Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
    -   Click on "Get API key" -> "Create API key".
    -   Copy the generated key.

2.  **Set the Key in NinjaRobot:**
    ```bash
    uv run ninja_core config set-key gemini YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE
    ```

    NinjaRobot queries Google's model catalog with the supplied key and lists Gemini models that support agent content generation. After you select a numbered model, NinjaRobot runs a bounded minimal generation request and saves the API key/model only if that request succeeds. Validation can take up to 60 seconds for a thinking model. A failed lookup, non-responsive model, or cancelled prompt leaves the existing Gemini configuration unchanged.

    The guided `uv run ninja_core init-tool` option performs the same model-selection flow while hiding the entered API key.

    Gemini 3 models use a bounded REST compatibility path with low thinking because the installed legacy Python SDK cannot configure their current thinking controls. A normal agent request may still take several seconds. The chat and server consoles show the configured model and return a visible error if the model exceeds the request timeout.

#### 3.2. Setup ngrok (For Remote Access)

To access the web server from outside your local network, you need an ngrok account.

1.  **Create an Account:**
    -   Go to [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/) and sign up for a free account.

2.  **Get Your Authtoken:**
    -   Go to your [ngrok Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
    -   Copy your Authtoken.

3.  **Configure NinjaRobot:**
    -   When you run `uv run ninja_core server` for the first time, you will be prompted to enter this token.
    -   `uv run ninja_core server` - Start the web interface (interactive mode)
    -   `uv run ninja_core server --autostart` - Start in non-interactive mode (for systemd)
    -   Alternatively, you can set it manually via the ngrok CLI if installed, but the server prompt is the easiest method.

#### 3.3. Run the Interactive Chat
    This command initializes the robot and the AI agent, allowing you to type commands.
    ```bash
    uv run ninja_core chat
    ```

#### 3.4. Test Capabilities
    -   **Nuance:** Type "I am feeling joyful." -> Robot should show a happy face.
    -   **Multilingual:** Type "こんにちは" (Konnichiwa). -> Robot should reply in Japanese.
    -   **Search:** Type "What is the weather in Tokyo?" -> Robot should search and answer.
    -   **Auto-Emotion:** Type "Tell me a joke." -> Robot should speak (show speaking face) while answering.
    -   **Movement:** Type "Do a wave." (if you recorded a 'wave' movement). -> Robot should execute the movement.

### Step 4: Test Web Server & Remote Access

The Web Server provides a user-friendly interface for controlling the robot from any device on the network or over the internet.

1.  **Start the Server:**
    ```bash
    uv run ninja_core server
    ```
    - The robot will initialize all hardware.
    - It will attempt to start an `ngrok` tunnel automatically.
    - **Check the Display:** The robot's LCD screen should display a **QR Code**.

2.  **Connect to the Interface:**
    - **Option A (Mobile/Remote):** Scan the QR code on the robot's screen with your phone.
    - **Option B (Local Network):** Open a browser on your computer and go to `http://<robot-ip>:8000` (The IP is printed in the terminal).

3.  **Test Web Features:**
    - **AI Chat & Voice Input:**
        - **Text Chat:** Type a message in the input box and click **Send**.
        - **Voice Input:** Select your language (English, 日本語, 繁體中文, 简体中文), click the  **`ninja_agent.py`** - AI Agent
  - Google Gemini integration for NLP
  - Semantic understanding and intent mapping
  - Auto-emotion generation
  - Action chaining (Movement, Faces, Sounds)
  - Multilingual support (EN/JP/ZH-TW/ZH-CN)he robot will detect the selected language and respond in the same language (including distinguishing between Traditional and Simplified Chinese).
    - **Servo Movements:** Select a movement from the dropdown and click **Execute**.
    - **Facial Expressions:** Select an expression and click **Show**.
    - **Sounds:** Select an emotion sound and click **Play**.
    - **Distance Sensor**: Verify that the distance reading updates in real-time (every ~200ms).
    - **System Controls**: Use the **Power Off Robot** button to safely shut down the Raspberry Pi.

4.  **Test Obstacle Avoidance (Safety):**
    - While a movement is executing (e.g., a long sequence), place your hand in front of the sensor (< 50mm).
    - **Expected Result:** The robot should **immediately stop**, display a "scary" face, play a warning sound, and the web interface should show an error or stop notification.
