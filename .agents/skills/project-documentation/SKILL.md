description: Use when implementation work changes behavior, setup, drivers, architecture, or developer workflow and the NinjaRobotPi0 documentation must be reviewed, fact-checked against the code, and updated before the task is considered complete.

# Project Documentation Maintainer

Documentation updates are mandatory when implementation changes behavior or developer workflow.

## Review targets
- README.md
- DevelopmentGuide.md
- DevelopmentLog.md
- InstallationGuide.md when setup, calibration, config import, or hardware bring-up changes
- the affected package `README.md`
- AGENT.md and relevant skill files when the project workflow changes

## Source-of-truth rule

Before editing docs, verify important claims against:

1. current code
2. tests and commands actually run
3. package metadata and entry points
4. existing docs

Do not copy stale claims from one document into another.

Before editing project documentation, use `robot-wiki-query` for the affected topic and compare its evidence with current code. The wiki is a knowledge layer, not a substitute for code-backed fact checking.

## Documentation rules
### README.md
Ensure it contains:
- project purpose
- architecture summary
- main functions
- driver overview
- setup steps
- usage examples
- only verified stack/version/tooling claims

### DevelopmentGuide.md
Ensure it contains:
- developer workflow
- file/module layout
- driver notes
- lint/test commands
- Raspberry Pi validation flow
- common troubleshooting notes
- public exports and CLI surfaces that match the code

### DevelopmentLog.md
Append a dated entry with:
- task summary
- files changed
- why the change was made
- lint/test results
- Raspberry Pi validation status
- follow-up work

### InstallationGuide.md
Ensure it is updated when user-visible setup changes, including:
- wiring assumptions
- required system packages or services
- calibration order
- config import/export steps
- first-run validation steps

### Package README
Ensure the affected package README reflects:
- package root exports
- CLI commands and examples
- config file names and defaults
- actual current runtime behavior
- troubleshooting and validation notes

## Completion rule
If code changed and docs were not reviewed, the task is not complete.
If docs changed, they are not complete until they have been fact-checked against the code.
If a mapped project document changed, the task is not complete until `robot-wiki-maintain` has checked the project/wiki source mirror and all remaining drift or pending wiki plans are reported.

Run the mirror gate after the final documentation edit:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/robot-wiki-maintain/scripts/wiki_source_sync.py --check
```

Do not hand-edit the mirrored copies under `Wiki/NinjaRobotPi0_Wiki/raw/` and do not auto-apply semantic wiki changes.

## Tone and style
- Always provide clear step-by-step instructions for setup, testing, and validation.
- Give concise explanations of each step's purpose and expected outcome.
- Use wording that is understandable to non-developer users. If any professional jargon or abbreviations are necessary, explain them in simple terms.
- If any code examples are included, ensure they are copy-paste ready and well-commented for clarity.
- If the same information appears in English, Japanese, and Traditional Chinese docs, keep those sections synchronized or explicitly note what still needs translation.
- Never state that Raspberry Pi validation or test execution happened unless it actually happened.
